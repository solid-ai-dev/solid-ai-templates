# Dev Journal

## 2026-04-27 — Skills roadmap

- Added Phase 15 (Skills) to `ROADMAP.md` with four categories:
  generative, transformation, review, ops — plus infrastructure tasks
- Renamed existing Phase 15 (Validation) to Phase 16
- Key insight: skills (dynamic, on-demand actions) complement static
  context files (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) — they don't replace them

---

## 2026-04-28 — 360 analysis, labels, ADRs, license

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Created `base/360.md` — four-category project assessment template
  (Value, Quality, Viability, Discovery) with role prompts and parallel
  subagent execution model (19 sub-dimensions, 78 checklist items)
- Standardized issue labels to 12 canonical labels with Atlassian-style
  colors across 11 repos (10 Imbra-Ltd + braboj/tutorial-git)
- Split `base/issues.md` (platform-agnostic types) from
  `platform/github.md` (GitHub label implementation)
- Updated `base/readme.md` — capability list requirement, dual-audience
  clarification
- Created `docs/decisions/` with 3 ADRs: inheritance model, label
  standardization, 360 analysis
- Added CC BY 4.0 license (LICENSE file + README update)
- Documented bus factor mitigation in ONBOARDING.md
- Improved README: capability list, project structure, dev setup, links

**PRs merged:** #73, #74, #75, #76

**Issues closed:** #58 (duplicate), #66, #67, #68, #70, #71, #18

**Decisions:**
- ADR-001: Three-layer inheritance model (base → layer → stack)
- ADR-002: 12 canonical labels, Atlassian colors, type/priority split
- ADR-003: 360-degree analysis as parallel subagent evaluation
- License: CC BY 4.0 — maximizes adoption funnel, requires attribution
- Labels split: types in base/ (platform-agnostic), colors in platform/
  (GitHub-specific)
- Severity stays in bug body text, not as label — solo project, priority
  drives triage order

## 2026-04-30 — v1.0.0 release, repo transfer, CI hardening

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Tagged v1.0.0 release
- Transferred repo from Imbra-Ltd to braboj
- Added `base/quality.md` rule: never hardcode derived counts
- Added audit decomposition guidance to `base/review.md`
- Added SEO conventions to `frontend/static-site.md` and
  `stack/static-site-astro.md` (sitemap, description, JSON-LD)
- Fixed stale references in SPEC.md, ROADMAP.md, ONBOARDING.md,
  PLAYBOOK.md (CONCEPTS.md, format files, section ordering)
- Fixed e2e crash bug (3-tuple return on skipped tests)
- Added `base/360.md` to manifest.yaml
- Fixed test spec frontmatter ID mismatch
- Added `--offline` mode to e2e runner — validates test
  infrastructure without API calls
- Refactored test runners: extracted `tests/lib.py` (shared
  utilities) and `tests/cases.py` (30 test cases grouped by area)
- Added `--area` and `--fail-fast` flags to e2e runner
- CI hardened: enforce_admins, require PR before merge, gitleaks
  in smoke workflow, push protection enabled, e2e switched to
  offline mode in CI
- Updated label colors: task `#579DFF`, epic `#9F8FEF`
- Added 8 GitHub topics for discoverability
- Updated all in-repo URLs and submodule pointers after transfer

**PRs merged:** #80, #81, #91, #92, #93, #94, #95, #96, #97, #98, #99

**Issues closed:** #79, #78, #55, #15, #16, #82, #83, #84, #85,
#86, #87, #88, #89, #69, #72, #10

**Issues created:** #82–#90, #100

**Decisions:**
- Repo transferred to braboj for better OSS discoverability
- E2E CI runs offline mode — live mode is manual/nightly only
- gitleaks CLI preferred over gitleaks-action (no license key needed)
- Label colors updated for accessibility (task, epic were too dark)
- pytest adoption deferred — hand-rolled runners are sufficient

## 2026-05-01 — Session protocol hardening (superseded)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**PRs:** #120

**Issues closed:** #105, #106, #107, #110, #119

**Key changes:**
- Hardened `base/scope.md` session startup with branch check, git
  status, issue review, and mandatory startup block requirement
- Added build-after-change rule to during-work section
- End-of-session audit now requires visible sequential execution with
  documented trigger phrases
- `base/core/agents.md` — all three models (inline, reference, hybrid)
  now reference `base/scope.md` instead of inlining an incomplete
  6-step checklist
- Added `examples/hybrid-astro/CLAUDE.md` — first reference/hybrid
  mode example demonstrating the startup block pattern

**Key decisions:**
- Startup block is only required for reference/hybrid modes — inline
  models are self-contained and exempt
- Examples use anonymized fictional projects to avoid maintenance burden

---

## 2026-05-01 — Convention hardening sweep

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**PRs:** #120, #121, #122, #123, #124

**Issues closed:** #105, #106, #107, #108, #109, #110, #111, #112,
#113, #114, #115, #116, #118, #119

**Key changes:**
- Session protocol: mandatory startup block, startup hygiene (branch/
  status/issues), build-after-change, visible sequential audit execution
- base/core/agents.md: all 3 models reference base/scope.md (no more
  incomplete inlined checklists)
- Quality: DRY/KISS/YAGNI core principles, Fail Fast/Law of Demeter/
  High Cohesion in maintainability, duplication erosion audit check
- Astro: View Transitions section with ClientRouter recommendation and
  DOMContentLoaded warning
- Docs: version bump in release process, session naming convention,
  milestone sync rule
- Added hybrid-mode example (examples/hybrid-astro/CLAUDE.md)
- Clarified extraction threshold: substantial logic blocks vs short
  inline repetition

**Also:** fixed 3 issue titles (removed commit-style prefixes), added
missing priority labels to #104, #105, #106

## 2026-05-04 — Composition over inheritance

Issues closed: #151, #149, #150
Issues created: #154 (implementation), #155 (repo org spike)

Three architecture spikes resolved in a single session. All decisions
recorded in ADR-004.

**#151 — Composition over inheritance (P1):**
- quality-gates.md depends on devsecops + cicd but never references
  their content — ISP violation. Remove both from depends_on.
- Core tier (5 files: quality, git, docs, readme, testing) always loaded.
  Manifest gets a top-level `core:` list.
- Stacks compose opt-in tiers explicitly — no transitive surprises.
- Stack classification: deployed services need devsecops + cicd; static
  sites, libraries, and mobile do not.
- Platform templates are facades — platform-github does not depend on
  devsecops.
- File headers must match manifest (direct deps only). 3 stale headers
  found: astro, hugo, tutorial.

**#149 — Pattern file integration (P2):**
- Evaluated 4 options (forward ref, manifest includes, auto-convention,
  resolution depth). All add complexity to the resolution algorithm.
- Deeper question: do agents need pattern tutorials? No — LLMs know
  standard patterns from training data. Agent context needs conventions,
  not recipes.
- Decision: remove all 5 pattern files from manifest and dependency
  graph. Move to docs/patterns/ as human reference. Parent rules files
  keep one-line summaries.

**#150 — Agent-side dependency resolution (P2):**
- Resolution algorithm: core → stack deps → extras → platform. All
  steps use RESOLVE_DEPS (recursive). Extras are recursive for safety.
- Algorithm runs at build time (tools/sync.py, interview), not at agent
  startup. Generates explicit file lists for CLAUDE.md startup blocks.
- Full IDs everywhere — explicit over implicit.

**Decisions (all in ADR-004):**
- ADR-004: Composition over inheritance in dependency model
- Manifest `core:` field for core tier
- Pattern files removed from dependency graph (~1700 lines saved)
- Build-time resolution, not runtime
- No profiles, no auto-convention, no pattern resolution logic

## 2026-05-04 — Pattern templates and quick wins batch

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**PRs:** #141, #142, #143, #144, #145, #148

**Issues closed:** #117, #104, #131, #135, #136, #137, #132, #130,
#133, #140, #139, #138

**Issues created:** #146, #147, #149, #150, #151

**Key changes:**
- New `base/cicd-patterns.md` — 8 reusable CI/CD patterns (gate job,
  path filtering, fan-out, artifact promotion, caching, matrix,
  auto-merge, deploy preview)
- New `base/testing-patterns.md` — 8 test patterns (factory, AAA,
  builder, parameterized, fixtures, mock boundary, snapshot, contract)
- New `frontend/patterns.md` — 8 UI patterns (error boundary, skeleton,
  optimistic update, virtual scroll, debounced search, form validation,
  responsive switch, URL state sync)
- New `base/security.md` — application security rules (12 sections:
  input, output, injection, auth, sessions, secrets, TLS, headers,
  errors, logging, CORS, uploads)
- New `base/security-patterns.md` — 8 app security patterns (slim,
  structural only)
- Rewrote `base/devsecops-patterns.md` — 8 pipeline security patterns
  (break-build gate, triage, SBOM, secret rotation, dep updates,
  security smoke, pre-merge gate, hardening loop)
- Expanded grading scale in `base/360.md` to include +/- modifiers
- Added audit tracking section to `base/360.md`
- Added remediation references section to `base/360.md`
- Batch quick wins: focus-visible, Dependabot, lychee root-dir,
  3 review checks, post-mortems, test factory defaults, sonarjs,
  boolean sort, explicit audit steps, ONBOARDING verify check

**Key decisions:**
- Pattern files are separate from rules files (rules say what,
  patterns say how) — different purposes, different audiences
- Security split: `security.md` (app rules) vs `devsecops.md`
  (pipeline rules), each with its own patterns companion
- Architecture spikes created for composition-over-inheritance
  (#151), pattern resolution (#149), agent-side resolution (#150)

## 2026-05-04 — Composition model, folder restructuring, roadmap removal

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**PRs:** #157, #158, #159, #160, #161

**Issues closed:** #153, #154, #155

**Key changes:**
- Removed `ROADMAP.md` — planned work tracked via GitHub milestones
- Added consumption model section to SPEC.md (declaration block,
  resolution algorithm, lifecycle diagram, two worked examples)
- ADR-005: apply Miller's law (7±2) to repo structure
- Implemented composition model from ADR-004: trimmed quality-gates
  deps, added `core:` tier to manifest, moved 5 pattern files to
  `docs/patterns/`, fixed 3 stale file headers, added explicit
  cicd+devsecops to 13 backend stacks
- Implemented ADR-005 folder restructuring: created `templates/`
  parent (root 12→6 dirs), split `base/` into 5 subfolders
  (core, security, infra, workflow, language), moved SPEC.md to
  `docs/`, moved INTERVIEW.md and manifest.yaml to `templates/`
- Removed `generated/` directory from tracking
- Fixed remote URL (Imbra-Ltd → braboj)
- Enabled auto-merge on repo
- Triaged 6 unlabeled issues with priority labels

**Key decisions:**
- ROADMAP.md replaced by GitHub milestones (no closed milestones
  for completed phases — dev journal covers history)
- Miller's law as organizing principle for folder structure
- SPEC.md belongs in docs/ (documentation, not template source)
- INTERVIEW.md and manifest.yaml belong in templates/ (part of
  the template system)
- Pattern files are human reference docs, not agent context

## 2026-05-04 — Release v2.0.0

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**PRs:** #174, #175, #176

**Issues closed:** #168, #169, #170, #171, #172, #173

**Key changes:**
- First 360-degree audit (`docs/audits/2026-05-04-360.md`) — grades:
  Value B+, Quality C+, Viability A-, Discovery D+
- Recovered lost agents.md move from orphaned branch
  `fix/claude-md-review` (formats/ → base/core/)
- Fixed E2E test paths broken after ADR-005 restructuring (27/30
  were failing, CI was red on main for 5+ merges)
- Fixed grpc.md line-1 corruption, README wrong path, PLAYBOOK
  step numbering, stale Imbra-Ltd link, DPL test paths
- Aligned CLAUDE.md with 6-section format spec (added § 4 Identity,
  renamed § 1.1 to Overview)
- E2E tests now gate PRs (moved from push-to-main only)
- Added stale-branch check to session startup and cleanup to
  end-of-session protocol
- Cleaned up 8 stale local/remote branches
- Enabled delete-branch-on-merge, added e2e to required checks

**Key decisions:**
- v2.0.0 due to breaking structural changes: ADR-004 composition
  model, ADR-005 folder restructuring, agents.md relocation,
  6-section format alignment
- Discovery (D+) identified as project bottleneck — needs launch
  post, social card, community presence before v3

## 2026-05-04 — v2.1.0 Polish + Quality sprint

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**PRs merged:** #194, #195, #196, #197, #201, #202, #204, #205,
#207, #209, #212, #214, #216, #223, #225, #226, #227, #228, #229

**Issues closed:** #188, #189, #190, #187, #183, #200, #178, #198,
#199, #206, #208, #211, #213, #215, #217, #218, #219, #220, #221,
#222

**Issues created:** #193–#224

**Releases:** v2.1.0 — Polish

**Key changes:**
- Created 7 milestones (v2.1–v2.5, v3.0, Backlog), assigned all
  29 open issues
- v2.1 Polish: README SEO rewrite, repo description with CLAUDE.md
  keywords, powered-by attribution in INTERVIEW.md, multi-agent
  output clarification, report-an-issue link
- ADR-006: standardized on 3-digit SemVer, added no-build release
  process (GitHub Releases), milestone = minor bump
- Moved release.md from base/infra to base/workflow
- Created base/data/ layer: data-modeling, data-governance,
  data-migration (moved data-quality from base/language)
- Moved config.md from backend to base/core, made stack-agnostic
  (added build-time vs runtime, naming conventions, config
  precedence, 12-factor reference)
- Covered all 12-factor app principles: added dependencies and
  port binding to config.md, disposability and admin processes
  to quality.md
- Covered OWASP Top 10 fully: added deserialization/data integrity
  (A08) and SSRF (A10) to security.md
- Fixed security doc hierarchy: added DEPENDS ON and EXTEND links
  to backend/auth.md, removed duplicated rules
- Template audit (3 parallel agents): found and fixed duplication,
  stale refs, missing DEPENDS ON headers, manifest mismatches
- Moved testability section from quality.md to testing.md
- Refactored backend-quality.md: added EXTEND for security overlap
- Consolidated duplicated testing rules in 4 backend templates
- Stripped all 18 inline "see templates/..." prose references —
  relationships tracked via [DEPENDS ON] headers only
- Added .gitignore guidance to git.md
- Added E2E-01 smoke check (validates cases.py paths resolve)
- Removed dead skipped tests FMT-03/04/05 (27 e2e tests now)
- Disabled wiki on repo

**Key decisions:**
- Inline cross-references are maintenance debt — use [DEPENDS ON]
  headers (machine-validated) instead of scattered prose refs
- Config is a foundational concern (base/core), not backend-specific
- 12-factor and OWASP are methodologies codified across base templates
- Milestones map 1:1 to minor releases (v2.1, v2.2, etc.)
- No-build projects skip chore PR, use tag + GitHub Releases

---

## 2026-05-04 — v2.2 milestone closure

- PR #232: made end-of-session audit steps explicit in CLAUDE.md §6.3
  (closes #139)
- Closed #137 (post-mortem convention) — already in docs.md
- Closed #136 (code review checks) — already in review.md
- Closed #132 (test factory conventions) — already in testing.md
- Moved #224, #203 from v2.2 to v2.5 (better fit for Templates &
  Content)
- Created #233 (spike: naming conventions for issues and PRs) in v2.5
- v2.2 — Quality milestone fully closed

---

## 2026-05-05 — E2E provider infrastructure and product clarity

- PR #235: provider-agnostic e2e runner (closes #100)
  - 5 providers: anthropic, gemini, deepseek, groq, claude-cli
  - Manifest-based dependency resolution (ADR-004 algorithm)
  - Retry with exponential backoff on rate limits
  - Full LLM output + prompt in reports
  - load_dotenv support, .env in .gitignore
- Tagged v2.2.0 (GitHub Release)
- Created #236 (resolve.py script for dependency resolution)
- Created #237 (document all user paths: web, API, agent)
- Created #238 (ADR: generation out of scope, templates are the product)
- Created #239 (expand smoke tests for structure/resolution)
- Created #240 (reduce live e2e to one canary test)
- Created #241 (drop --offline mode)
- Created #242 (audit docs for unsustainable claims)

**Key decisions:**
- Generation is not the product — the template library is
- Local agents (Claude Code, Codex) are the primary user path
- API-based generation has inherent limitations (model fidelity,
  token limits, rate limits) — document, don't guarantee
- Live e2e tests are internal quality tools, not a product feature
- One canary test (python-lib) is more valuable than 27 flaky tests

## 2026-05-06 — v2.3 Tooling batch (P2 sweep)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**PRs merged:**
- #245 — ADR-007: generation is out of scope (docs/decisions/)
- #250 — Agent secrets handling rules (security-agent-secrets)
- #246 — Expanded smoke tests: MNF-02, MNF-03, MNF-04 (8 → 11 checks)
- #247 — E2e canary default (STK-15 python-lib, --all flag)
- #248 — Drop --offline mode, delete e2e.yml workflow
- #249 — tools/resolve.py + 30 pre-resolved files in generated/

**Issues closed:** #238, #239, #240, #241, #236, #244

**Key changes:**
- Smoke suite now validates manifest resolution for all stacks
- Default `py tests/run_e2e.py` runs only the canary test
- `tools/resolve.py` implements ADR-004 resolution (--list, --concat,
  --generate, --check)
- `generated/` directory committed with pre-resolved chain per stack
- `sync.py --check` now validates generated/ files
- Branch protection updated: only `smoke` required (removed `e2e`)
- run_e2e.py refactored to use shared resolver from tools/resolve.py

## 2026-05-06 — v2.3 Tooling milestone completion

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Added `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting (#184, PR #254)

## 2026-05-06 — Generated stacks audit

- Tool: Claude Code (Opus 4.6)
- Audited 5 generated stacks: terraform, tutorial, python-lib, react-spa, go-service
- Created #264 (audit parent) + 4 sub-issues (#265–#268)

## 2026-05-31 — Viability spikes and milestone-rule fix

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)

**PRs opened:**

**Issue grooming:**
- Triaged 13 open issues: every open issue now has type + priority
  + milestone (#332, #333, #334, #335, #337, #344, #345, #348,
  #351, #354, #355, #356, #357)
- New convention-rule issues parked in v2.5; restructure-scope
  issues in v3.0

**Key changes:**
- Milestone rule added to `templates/platform/github.md` under
  the existing `[EXTEND: base-issues-types]` block — milestones
  are a GitHub feature, so the rule belongs in the platform layer,
  not in platform-agnostic `base/workflow/issues.md`
- Two spikes opened motivated by me-fuji CLAUDE.md bloat (29KB,
  349 lines) and its forced 17-file SessionStart preload: #349
  proposes a three-layer knowledge model (conventions / deep
  knowledge / extractable tutorials), #350 is the broader
  viability meta-audit

**Process notes:**
- First pass at the milestone rule landed in the wrong layer
  (base instead of platform) and was duplicated in this repo's
  own CLAUDE.md — caught during template re-read, reverted, and
  reapplied correctly. Root cause: skipped the §6.1 startup
  template read before editing the templates themselves.
- Reinforces the case for #330 / #355 (mandatory template-file
  reads at session start) — even with the rules visible, an
  agent that doesn't read them edits at the wrong layer.

**Lessons captured:** these are template-relevant, not
project-specific — the layer-placement discipline (platform-
specific concepts belong in the platform template, not base)
should be reflected in #354's doc-placement decision tree when
that issue is worked.

**Continued — v2.5 closeout:**

After the spike work, picked up v2.5 — Conventions one by one.
All 12 originally-open v2.5 issues plus #352 (filed and merged
during session) are now closed. Milestone shows 14 closed / 0 open.

**PRs merged (continued):**
- #353 — Require milestone on every GitHub issue (#352)
- #359 — Forbid force-push, even --force-with-lease (#329)
- #361 — De-stack a PR by branching fresh + cherry-pick (#336)
- #362 — Add GitHub Release step to with-manifest release path (#338)
- #363 — Add doc-placement decision tree (#354)
- #365 — Rewrite end-of-session step 6 around content rules (#355)
- #366 — Agent context trade-offs pattern doc (#356)
- #367 — Multi-template loading + template dilution coverage (#356)
- #370 — Split template content quality into docs/meta/ (#356)
- #371 — Agent output style rule (#351)
- #372 — Match document convention rule (#357)
- #373 — Branch cleanup at session startup (#326)
- #374 — YAGNI revisit trigger discipline (#340)
- #375 — Import-time env mutation testing rule (#341)
- #376 — CodeQL paths-ignore for captured fixtures (#343)
- #377 — Skip noisy gates on equivalent-input PRs (#348)

**Issues created (continued):**
- #364 — Smoke check SYS-02 false-positive on inline ID refs
  (bug, Backlog)
- #368 — Spike: measure cold-start and template-loading cost
  (scopes 1+2, v3.0)
- #369 — Spike: cross-window cold-start comparison (Backlog,
  blocked on #368)

**Key changes:**
- New docs/meta/ folder for library-facing reference material
  (agent-context-tradeoffs.md, template-content-quality.md) —
  distinct from docs/patterns/ which is project-facing
- Agent-behavior cluster in base/workflow/ai-workflow.md now
  covers four rules: doc placement, end-of-session content,
  output style, document-convention matching
- base/core/git.md gains three rules: no-force-push, de-stack PR,
  optional gh release create step
- base/core/quality.md YAGNI bullet extended with revisit-trigger
  discipline
- base/core/testing.md gains env-mutation-isolation rule
- platform/github.md gains milestone requirement and CodeQL
  paths-ignore for fixtures
- base/workflow/quality-gates.md gains conditional-skip pattern
  for noisy output gates
- base/workflow/scope.md session startup gains branch cleanup
  step (step 5), end-of-session step 6 rewritten around
  doc-placement decision tree

**Process notes (continued):**
- Switched mid-session to `gh pr merge --auto --squash
  --delete-branch` per user direction — saved time on the long
  v2.5 sweep
- The PR #370 saga (mid-PR split into two files, then folder move
  to docs/meta/) illustrated the doc-placement decision tree
  *operating in real time*: the dilution discussion outgrew its
  host file, then the new file revealed it didn't belong in
  patterns/. Both reorganizations were the right call mid-stream.

**Lessons captured (continued):** the v2.5 closeout demonstrates
that small, focused, well-anchored PRs scale well with auto-merge.
The agent-behavior cluster in ai-workflow.md ended up as four
sibling sections — proves the YAGNI hold from #354 (don't pre-emptively
create agent-behavior.md) was correct. The split into docs/meta/
was the right move when content actually accumulated.
## 2026-06-02 — v2.6 agent discipline & ADR governance

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Fixed SYS-02 smoke check to treat inline `[ID:]` references as
  references, not declarations — sole-line shape only. Routed
  SYS-02, TPL-04, TPL-06, TPL-07, TPL-08, TPL-09 through a shared
  `iter_id_declarations()` helper. Spec updated (#364, PR #383)
- Added close-and-resubmit pattern to `base/core/git.md` under
  Pull requests — codifies SHOULD close + new PR when branch /
  title / body no longer match the actual decision (#382, PR #384)
- Added Probe scripts subsection to `base/core/quality.md` under
  Debug code — throwaway investigation scripts (`probe_*.py`)
  MUST be deleted before commit; findings move to comments / ADRs
  / docs (#360, PR #385)
- Added Generated files section to `base/core/docs.md` between
  Docs-as-code and Output file by agent — banner + `--check` flag
  + formatter-ignore SHOULDs (#380, PR #386)
- Added Verify working directory before concluding on a negative
  rule to `base/workflow/ai-workflow.md` with
  `[ID: ai-workflow-pwd-on-negative]` — pwd check as first
  diagnostic step on unexpected negative path queries (#358, PR #388)
- Added inline-ASCII-diagram SHOULD rule for non-trivial ADRs to
  the Decision logs section of `base/core/docs.md` — plain ASCII
  (+/-/|), not Unicode box-drawing (#342, PR #389)
- Added Findings docs subsection to `base/core/docs.md` Decision
  logs — lightweight markdown co-located with data, distinguishing
  from ADRs (decisions) and dev journal (history) (#347, PR #390)
- Recorded ADR-010 ADR governance model + `docs/decisions/TEMPLATE.md`
  — YAML frontmatter (id, status, date, category, supersedes,
  superseded_by); closed status set (Proposed / Accepted /
  Superseded); closed category set (composition, templates,
  tooling, process, release); two-way supersession links as the
  ONE exception to immutability; flat-folder + status-filter
  archival; ADRs MUST NOT cite other ADRs in prose except via
  the frontmatter graph (#379, PR #394)

**Audit at session start:**
- Closed #304 as already done (RFC 2119 keywords already in
  `base/core/docs.md` Rule language table)
- Closed #327 as already done (wrap-up checklist in `scope.md`
  already enumerates steps 6 and 9 with "Name the section")
- Closed #328 as duplicate of #337 (newer, more concrete version
  of the docs/audits/ proposal)

**Triage:**
- 5 unmilestoned backlog issues moved to Backlog (#358, #360,
  #380, #381, #382) — none fit v3.0 restructure scope
- Created v2.6 milestone with 8 issues (Mixed: agent discipline
  + ADR governance + smoke bug)

**Follow-up issues created from session work:**
- #387 — Apply generated-file banner + --check to this repo's
  `generated/` files (dogfood ADR-010's convention)
- #391 — ADR migration: retrofit frontmatter onto ADRs 001-009
- #392 — Smoke check: enforce ADR frontmatter schema
- #393 — `CLAUDE.md` §2.9: summarize ADR governance, point to
  TEMPLATE.md

**Issues closed:** #304, #327, #328, #342, #347, #358, #360,
  #364, #379, #380, #382 (11 total — 8 v2.6 + 3 audit)

**PRs merged:** #383, #384, #385, #386, #388, #389, #390, #394

**v2.6 closeout: 8/8 done.**

## 2026-06-02 — README clarify + dogfood generated-file convention

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- README "How to use" section reworked: section 1 is now the
  fastest path (clone + tell the agent to read
  `templates/manifest.yaml`, agent picks the stack and follows
  `[DEPENDS ON]` itself). Sections 1 and 2 lead with a one-line
  "fastest / guided" contrast; stale "attaching a single file"
  comparison reworded; prerequisites narrowed to local coding
  agents; orphaned pre-resolved-file bullet dropped from Model
  limitations (PR #406)
- Dogfooded the generated-file banner + `--check` convention from
  PR #386: `tools/resolve.py` now prepends an identifying banner
  to every emitted file (banner names producing tool, refresh
  command, check command per `docs.md`). Wired both
  `py tools/sync.py --check` and `py tools/resolve.py --check`
  into `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`. Regenerating revealed weeks
  of silent drift in `generated/` (lines per file +200–300
  from earlier template additions never re-cached) — the new CI
  check would have caught it (#387, PR #407)

**PRs merged:** #406, #407

**Issues closed:** #387

## 2026-06-03 — v2.8 data discipline & calibration

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Shipped v2.8 milestone (8 issues) — three new sections in
  `templates/base/data/data-quality.md` plus one in
  `templates/base/workflow/quality-gates.md`
- Calibration discipline triad (PR #410, closes #344 / #346 / #381):
  ground truth from raw artifacts, thresholds move not the
  measurement, reference data provenance (`source: agent|user|external`
  + `verified: true|false` + coverage caveat in metrics).
  #381 redrafted from prohibition to provenance approach after
  discussion — preserves agent-eye-read speed while keeping user
  as judge
- Cross-validation and tool trust pair (PR #411, closes #333 / #335):
  verify the tool before trusting its output; distinguish source-
  silent from source-says-false
- Data research workflow pair (PR #412, closes #331 / #339):
  source-conflict resolution (authority + poison-pill), full-record
  audit, content-aware figure cropping, content-based cache validity
  (no blind TTL)
- Gate scope agreement (PR #413, closes #334): ignore lists and CI
  path-filter must agree, skipped is not passed, PR gate mirrors
  deploy gate. Closes the gate-by-omission anti-pattern
- Filed two backlog spikes: #414 (skills as UX layer on top of
  templates) and #415 (name-collision strategy for skills + slash
  commands). Sellability discussed and deferred — skills land free
  first, paid layer only after adoption data justifies it

**Gap flagged for follow-up:** `base/data/data-quality.md` is not
in any stack's `[DEPENDS ON]` chain, so the new data rules are
discoverable in the base layer but don't reach any
`generated/<stack>.md`. Candidate for v2.9.

**PRs merged:** #410, #411, #412, #413

**Issues closed:** #331, #333, #334, #335, #339, #344, #346, #381

**Issues filed:** #414 (spike), #415 (spike)

## 2026-06-03 (afternoon) — Expedite lane + milestone hygiene

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Created **Expedite** milestone (#15) — rolling fast-track lane for
  bugs, incidents, and small tasks shipping between versioned
  releases. Never closes; issues move in when expedited and out when
  shipped
- Codified Expedite in `templates/platform/github.md` Issue labels
  section (PR #420, closes #419), and extended the milestone-required
  rule from "every issue" to "every issue and pull request" with
  guidance that PRs SHOULD inherit the milestone of the issue they
  close
- Added per-folder-commit guidance to `base/core/git.md` Squash-merge
  safety section (PR #417, closes #409): prefer one focused commit
  per scope-slice over per-folder atomic commits — the squash
  collapses them, document the breakdown in the PR description
- Created **v2.9** milestone (#14) — "Data discoverability & gap
  fixes". Holds #418 (wire `base/data/data-quality.md` into stack
  DEPENDS ON chains — addresses gap flagged in v2.8) plus #403
  (README hook→problem→solution micro-structure) which shipped
  this session
- Codified hook → problem → solution micro-structure in
  `base/core/readme.md` §1 (PR #421, closes #403): three paragraph
  beats with sentence counts, optional italic differentiator
  subtitle, coexists with the four-content-fields rule
- Reassigned three closed issues from Backlog to their actual
  release milestones: #327 → v2.6, #138 → v2.5, #133 → v2.5. Five
  triage-only closures (1 duplicate, 4 wontdo) left in Backlog
  since no work shipped

**Lesson:** missed assigning PRs #417 and #420 to the Expedite
milestone at creation — rule said "every issue" but didn't cover
PRs. Caught and codified in the same PR (#420) that documents
Expedite, so the rule now self-applies

**PRs merged:** #417, #420, #421

**Issues closed:** #403, #409, #419

**Issues filed:** #418 (v2.9), #419 (Expedite)

**Milestones created:** v2.9 (#14), Expedite (#15)

## 2026-06-03 (evening) — v2.9.0 cut

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Closed v2.9's only open issue (#418): wired `base-data-quality`
  into `stack-python-service`, propagating transitively to Flask,
  FastAPI, and Django generated chains. Resolves the v2.8
  discoverability gap (`data-quality.md` rules now reach
  `generated/<stack>.md` for Python service stacks)
- Wrote ADR-012 bounding scope to python-service only; other
  backend stacks (Go, Node, Java, Celery) remain unwired pending
  the file-split decision
- Filed #424 as follow-up: audit `data-quality.md` and separate
  agent-behavior rules (calibration, cross-validation, research)
  from true data-heavy schema rules. The file's name overstates
  the data framing — three of four sections apply to any
  investigative work
- Cut v2.9.0: tag pushed, GitHub Release created, milestone closed

**Lesson:** when a base/ file's content is broader than its layer
suggests, wiring it forces a choice between leaving rules
unreachable or pulling unrelated dependencies. Better to question
the file's home (split or rename) than to over-wire — captured
as #424 follow-up

**PRs merged:** #425

**Issues closed:** #418

**Release:** v2.9.0 (https://github.com/braboj/solid-ai-templates/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

## 2026-06-24 — v2.10 data-quality finish & generator discipline

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Closed v2.10 — Data-quality finish (8/8 issues) across four
  theme PRs
- #424 split: moved **calibration discipline** and
  **cross-validation / tool-trust** out of `base-data-quality` into
  core `base-quality` so they reach all 30 stacks; the
  **data-research workflow** and data-schema rules stay in
  `base-data-quality` (opt-in via #298). ADR-013 records the split
  and supersedes ADR-012
- #431 + #443: added **diagnose-before-tuning** and **calibration
  aids must not depict the system's own output** as subsections of
  the now-core Calibration discipline section in `base-quality`
- #434 + #435: **coverage-by-cohort** data-validation pattern in
  `base-testing`; **fail-loud over auto-derivation** near Fail Fast
  in `base-quality`
- #437 + #444 + #445: generator-discipline trio — regenerate on
  input change (`base-docs`), regenerate derived artifacts in the
  fixing PR (`base-git`), and a new **Generated-file staleness
  gate** section in `base-quality-gates` making the `--check`
  invocation a required CI check
- Triaged the 72 then-unmilestoned issues into Backlog at the start
  of the session (Backlog 30 → 102)

**Lesson:** #424's stated premise — "agent-behavior rules reach all
stacks via `base-ai-workflow`" — was refuted on inspection:
`base-ai-workflow` is not in the core tier and no stack declares it,
so it reaches zero generated chains. Moving the rules there would
have *regressed* reach (they currently reach the Python-service
chain via ADR-012). Verify a rule's actual reach (core tier vs
opt-in) before choosing its home; core `base-quality` was the only
placement that satisfies "reach all stacks." The same correction
applied to #431's suggested `ai-workflow.md` home.

**PRs merged:** #534, #535, #536, #537

**Issues closed:** #424, #431, #434, #435, #437, #443, #444, #445

**Milestone:** v2.10 — Data-quality finish (8/8 closed)

**Release:** v2.10.0 (https://github.com/braboj/solid-ai-templates/releases/tag/v2.10.0)

## 2026-06-24 — v2.11 docs & ADR conventions

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Planned and shipped v2.11 — Docs & ADR conventions (8 issues, 5
  theme PRs)
- Before starting: brought 23 backlog issues into `github.md`
  compliance (added missing `task` type and `P3` priority labels) —
  0 type/priority/milestone violations remain
- #505 (PR #539): general Markdown/docs style rules in
  `base/core/docs.md` — ADR tables, visual restraint, diagram + Mermaid
  gotchas. Re-applied from the stale `docs/markdown-style-rules` branch
- #513 (PR #540): arc42 authoring conventions — chapter boundaries
  (§2 vs §4, §3 black-box, §9 ADR index), ID schemes (FR01/QG01),
  concept-section tables; folded in #503's arc42 points
- #489 + #533 (PR #541): one concern per ADR (recorded as ADR-014,
  with CLAUDE.md §2.9 + TEMPLATE.md pointers) and same-day
  supersession-when-premise-refuted guidance
- #529 + #507 + #515 (PR #542): milestone-on-purpose (`github.md`),
  upstream-flag end-of-session steps (`scope.md`, re-applied from the
  stale branch), layer-aligned identifiers (`oop.md`)
- #500 (PR #543): kept `dev-journal.md` (rename to SESSIONS.md deferred
  to v3.0), documented the SHOUT-vs-kebab casing split, added a
  required-contents entry schema, and reconciled `docs.md` to the
  journal's actual newest-first / `## YYYY-MM-DD — Theme` format

**Lesson:** two pairs of issues overlapped and were deduped at plan
time rather than landing conflicting edits — #503 folded into #513
(arc42), and #505's general style rules landed first so #513 could be
trimmed to arc42-specifics. #489 is self-referential: by its own
"one concern per ADR" rule it split from #533 into ADR-014, leaving the
supersession guidance docs-only. This entry is the first written under
the #500 schema it documents.

**PRs merged:** #539, #540, #541, #542, #543

**Issues closed:** #489, #500, #505, #507, #513, #515, #529, #533

**Milestone:** v2.11 — Docs & ADR conventions (8/8 closed)

**Release:** v2.11.0 (https://github.com/braboj/solid-ai-templates/releases/tag/v2.11.0)

**Next:** planned v2.12 — Probe-first workflow lessons (#18, 9 issues) —
ai-workflow probe/verify-before-acting sweep I; #482 closed as a
duplicate of #477. Not yet started.

---

## 2026-06-24 — v2.12 probe-first workflow lessons

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Planned and shipped v2.12 — Probe-first workflow lessons (9 issues,
  2 theme PRs) — all 9 were the same lesson at different decision
  points, consolidated into 2 Lessons Learned subsections in
  `base/workflow/ai-workflow.md` rather than 9 fragments
- #468 + #471 + #450 + #459 + #532 + #477 + #481 + #474 (PR #546):
  "Probe before acting on a hypothesis" — run the cheapest probe that
  would refute a hypothesized mechanism / proposed fix / inherited
  diagnosis before acting; enumerates the decision points (before
  coding a proposed fix, before drafting an ADR, at spike intake, on a
  diagnosis inherited from prior-session memory, before filing a bug),
  the "probe the artifact, not your reading of it" corollary, and the
  record-the-inversion / throwaway-probe discipline
- #496 (PR #547): "Verify external state before a visible action" —
  before filing an issue/PR on a third-party repo, taking a
  dependency, or pulling a vendored fixture, confirm the target is the
  real project, the repo is live (not archived/migrated), and the
  channel is open; a failed check feeds back to the stale ADR / README
  / memory pointer, not just the blocked action

**Lesson:** the nine issues overlapped almost entirely, so they were
deduped at plan time into two cohesive subsections — the issues
themselves flagged the overlap (#474 suggested one combined section,
and #471/#450 carried forward from #468). No ADR was written: it is
template content, not a structural/system decision. No inline `.md`
cross-reference was added either — several issues requested a pointer
to `quality.md` §Probe scripts, but this layer expresses relationships
via `[DEPENDS ON]` headers only, so the throwaway-probe point was
stated self-contained instead.

**PRs merged:** #546, #547

**Issues closed:** #450, #459, #468, #471, #474, #477, #481, #496, #532

**Milestone:** v2.12 — Probe-first workflow lessons (9/9 closed)

**Release:** v2.12.0 (https://github.com/braboj/solid-ai-templates/releases/tag/v2.12.0)

**Next:** v3.0 — Restructure (13 issues) — inline-to-reference eval,
slim stacks.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Maintenance: dependency bump + branch prune

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Merged Dependabot PR #524 — `actions/checkout` 6→7 in
  `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`; branch was BEHIND `main` under strict
  checks, so ran `gh pr update-branch` (not force-push) and waited for
  the smoke re-run to go green before squash-merging
- Pruned stale remote-tracking refs (4 already-merged docs branches +
  the merged dependabot branch) via `git remote prune origin`

**Lesson:** the "stale remote branches" in `git branch -a` were only
stale local tracking refs — server-side auto-delete-on-merge had
already removed them, and `git ls-remote` confirmed the live remote
held just `main`. Verify against the remote before attempting a
server-side delete (the same verify-external-state discipline #547
codified the day before).

**PRs merged:** #524

**Issues closed:** none

## 2026-06-25 — v2.13 CI/CD & release hardening

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Planned and shipped v2.13 — CI/CD & release hardening (7 issues, 5
  theme PRs), chosen as a concrete intermediate milestone before the
  v3.0 restructure, from a CI/CD cluster in the Backlog
- #499 (PR #550, P2): CI workflow authoring rules from a real gitleaks
  outage — authenticate `api.github.com` calls (shared-runner rate
  limit), fail loud on shell-pipeline-resolved values, and verify a
  tool's pricing/license before adopting it (added to ai-workflow's
  "Verify external state" section, not the issue's suggested home)
- #510 (PR #551): pin third-party GitHub Actions to commit SHAs, with
  the version in a trailing comment so Dependabot still bumps them
- #509 + #438 (PR #552): Dependabot weekly-batch triage —
  lockfile-conflict cascade, auto-supersede, aggregator-timing, fix-PR-
  first for lint-rule bumps, and co-dependent caret-range rebase
- #528 + #531 (PR #553): per-tag GitHub Release as the durable record
  (tag-gated, idempotent, deploy-independent) + SBOM uploaded to it,
  guarded and continue-on-error so a scan hiccup never erases it
- #497 (PR #554): distinguish CI infra failures from diff failures when
  judging PR readiness (new CI-signals section in review.md)

**Lesson:** `git add -A` swept the untracked `.claude/` and
`docs/drafts`+`docs/spikes` working dirs into PR B's commit. Caught it
before opening the PR, undid via `git reset --mixed HEAD~1`, deleted the
just-pushed remote branch (not a force-push — no PR, no collaborators),
and re-pushed staging explicit paths. Use explicit `git add <paths>`,
never `-A`, while those dirs sit untracked.

**PRs merged:** #550, #551, #552, #553, #554

**Issues closed:** #499, #510, #509, #438, #528, #531, #497

## 2026-06-25 — v2.14 Workflow & quality lessons

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Assessed the 77-issue Backlog (dominated by ~50 lesson fragments;
  only Python-stack (7) and Frontend (6) remain as concrete clusters)
- Transferred 3 Backlog issues into v3.0 — Restructure per the
  "big / requires real restructuring → v3.0, else do it earlier"
  rule: #492 (extract abstract frontend-content layer), #414 + #415
  (skills-as-UX-layer initiative). #369 (cold-start measurement) kept
  in Backlog — small, pairs with v3.0's #368 when that work runs
- Planned and shipped v2.14 — Workflow & quality lessons (13 issues,
  3 theme PRs), a consolidation round folding lesson fragments into
  existing sections rather than fragmenting
- #485 + #484 + #486 + #526 + #494 (PR #556): "Verify before relying" —
  routed to correct homes, not one section: handoff-note counts decay
  (ai-workflow.md), a dep bump is verified by the gate not the changelog
  (ai-workflow.md), audit downstream renders when truth changes
  (ai-workflow.md), reasoning comments rot (quality.md), green CI ≠
  environment-independent (quality-gates.md)
- #501 + #527 + #516 + #430 (PR #557): "Plan & scope discipline" —
  read in-source audit comments at the edit site (new ai-workflow
  Practices section, P2), constraints invalidate plans mid-execution
  (ai-workflow Lessons), reconcile recommendations/breadcrumbs against
  documented scope + current milestone before planning (scope.md)
- #460 + #480 + #525 + #502 (PR #558): "Gate & test honesty" —
  disaggregate verdict/plausibility/accuracy + lenient gates need a
  human residual check (quality-gates.md), numerical gates lock
  magnitudes not contours (review.md), tests should name what they pin
  (testing.md)

**Lesson:** when consolidating a lesson family, route each item to its
*semantically correct* file rather than the milestone's headline file —
forcing #526 (reading code comments) or #486 (gate scope) into
ai-workflow.md would have mis-placed them. One concern can span files
(ADR-014); the headline theme is not the mandatory home.

**PRs merged:** #556, #557, #558

## 2026-06-25 — v2.15 Backend & resilience + repo hygiene

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Added a labels-at-creation rule to CLAUDE.md §2.2 (#566, PR #567),
  fast-tracked via Expedite — labels applied at creation, never an
  unlabeled ticket
- Planned and shipped v2.15 — Backend & resilience (milestone #21,
  7 issues + 1 spawned, 6 PRs). Chose a concrete theme over a third
  consecutive lessons-drain; triaged #498 (generation-fidelity bug) →
  Expedite, closed #457 wontdo, assigned #560/#561/#563 → Backlog
- Spike #564 (decision, no ADR): generic async-resilience rules extend
  existing `messaging.md` (route C — generic home + thin webhook
  surface, no new file/layer). Corrected the issue's gap analysis (DLQ
  was already covered in messaging.md + jobs.md); spawned impl #568
- #568 (PR #569): `messaging.md` "Load & backpressure" — decouple under
  load, debounce/coalesce, backpressure on saturation, per-key fairness
- #521 + #522 (PR #570): reject non-finite JSON floats (`http.md`) +
  nosniff cross-platform MIME caveat (`security.md` Security headers,
  not devsecops.md)
- #446 + #439 (PR #571): import-cycle → shared third module, and
  return-type back-compat shim (`quality.md` Maintainability)
- #447 (PR #572): opt-in DiagnosticSink pipeline pattern →
  `observability.md` (moved off the planned quality-gates.md — a gate
  verifies, a sink instruments for debugging)
- #565 (PR #573): new `backend/webhooks.md`, register-only (composition
  over inheritance, ADR-004) — composes the resilience substrate via
  `[DEPENDS ON]`, adds only the webhook-specific surface; 0 chains wired
- Repo hygiene: gitignored `.claude/` (PR #574); removed `docs/drafts/`
  (obsolete) and `docs/spikes/` (findings for open spikes #350/#479
  archived to those issues first, then deleted)

**Lesson:** plan-time placements need verification against real file
contents before writing. Two of this milestone's planned homes were
wrong on inspection. The "missing DLQ" in #564 was already covered;
the DiagnosticSink home in #447 (quality-gates.md) conflated a gate
(which verifies) with an instrument (which debugs), and belongs in
observability.md. Verify the gap or the home, then write.

## 2026-06-25 — v2.16 Generation fidelity & mechanical checks

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Planned v2.16 (milestone #22) from the two Expedite items and two
  Backlog siblings — theme: a derived/generated artifact faithfully
  carries its constraints, each backed by an agent-runnable check.
  Drained Expedite to empty; #563 left in Backlog (off-theme)
- Branch hygiene: confirmed `origin` auto-deletes on merge — the 18
  "stale" branches were already gone remotely; only local tracking refs
  were stale (`git remote prune origin`, not `push --delete`)
- #479 (PR #578): pair-the-check convention — a mechanically-checkable
  output constraint MUST name its agent-runnable check; subjective ones
  stay declarative. Landed as `quality-gates-pair-check` (generalizes
  `quality-gates-staleness`) + CLAUDE.md §2.7. Spike decision, no ADR
- #560 (PR #579): bulk-emit scripts MUST expose `--check` and report the
  stale-entry *count*, not just the path (`base-docs` Generated files)
- #561 (PR #580): convention-as-test — an "if X then Y" derived-artifact
  invariant MUST be a test, not a written convention
  (`quality-gates-convention-as-test`)
- #498 (PR #582): the end-of-session audit was paraphrased into lossy
  bullets in hybrid generation. `agents.md` §6.3 (all 3 output models) +
  hybrid what-to-inline now mandate inline-verbatim or hard-delegation
  ("execute each item; do not summarize"), never paraphrase; new smoke
  check **SYS-05** gates the enforcement phrase in the output spec and
  every example session-protocol section. Fixed `hybrid-astro`; spawned
  #581 (refresh the 7 stale §6-less examples)

**Lesson:** ground a check's target against the real artifacts before
building it. #498's literal ask — "smoke-check the generated CLAUDE.md
§6.3" — did not map: 7 of 8 in-repo examples have no §6 at all, and the
one that did only soft-referenced. The check had to target the output
spec (`agents.md`) plus the single compliant example, and the staleness
became its own ticket (#581). The whole milestone dogfooded #479: each
issue shipped its rule *with* its check, so the convention did not decay
the way the §2.7 constraints had.

**PRs merged:** #578, #579, #580, #582

**Issues closed:** #479, #560, #561, #498

## 2026-06-25 — v2.17 Workflow lessons: bulk & shared-path fix discipline

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Planned v2.17 (milestone #23) as a lessons-drain over the Backlog's
  bulk / shared-path fix fragments (me-fuji probe-and-fix sessions),
  deferring the v3.0 restructure spikes (#350/#179/#180). 9 issues
  consolidated into 5 generic rules across 5 PRs
- Ran a genericity pass before implementing each rule — the "generic,
  not one-stack" bar demoted two issues to folded examples rather than
  standalone content: #458 (byte-hash cohort dup → data-stack-specific)
  and #472 (dispatch-surface sweep → me-fuji-shaped)
- #442 (PR #584): bulk-operations skip-list-then-unblock in `git.md` —
  split a bulk op that hits a per-item bug into two stacked PRs
  (skip-list + tracking issue, then fix + re-run + unblock)
- #465/#466/#470 (PR #585): "Verifying regenerated artifacts" in
  `git.md` — filter CRLF/whitespace noise, visually spot-check binary
  artifacts, and at scale pair a representative spot-check with a global
  metric instead of inspecting all N
- #456/#458 (PR #586): probe cohort breadth before scoping a fix —
  folded into `ai-workflow.md`'s existing "Probe before acting" rather
  than a parallel subsection (avoids the redundancy #350 flags)
- #478/#472 (PR #587): "Shared-path fixes verify every call site" in
  `testing.md` (`testing-shared-path-breadth`) — exercise every call
  site against ground truth ("expected unchanged" is the bug case) and
  re-run every downstream consumer that emits a committed artifact
- #563 (PR #588): "Tooling-produced scope creep is silent" in
  `scope.md` — revert a generator/formatter's unrequested side effects
  before committing, file the drift separately

**Lesson:** for a lessons-drain sourced from one downstream project, the
genericity pass is the load-bearing step, not the wording. Two of nine
fragments only survived as examples inside a generic rule; shipping them
verbatim would have put one-stack content into the core templates every
stack loads — exactly the attention-dilution #350 warns against. Folding
related fragments into an existing rule beat adding parallel subsections.

**PRs merged:** #584, #585, #586, #587, #588

**Issues closed:** #442, #465, #466, #470, #456, #458, #478, #472, #563

## 2026-06-25 — v2.18 Process & workflow lessons

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Planned three pre-restructure milestones to drain the lessons-learned
  backlog before v3.0: v2.18 (process/workflow), v2.19 (quality/testing/
  maintainability), v2.20 (concrete Python/frontend). 48 issues drained
  from Backlog, batched into PRs by target file.
- Drained v2.18 in 8 PRs / 19 issues. The `ai-workflow.md` cluster (14
  issues; reference-only, so no chain restale) landed in 4 PRs:
  probe-with-production-harness + Debugging-multi-stage (#593);
  survey-prior-art, Triage-prototype-cost, Spike-findings-home (#594);
  measure-before-revert, host-maintenance, manual-workaround (#595);
  verify-plan-time-placement, Triage-by-fan-out, Middle-scope (#596).
- `issues.md`: labels-at-creation + Deferred-work-with-named-trigger
  (#597). `git.md`: repeat the closing keyword before each issue number
  (#598, regen 30 chains). `scope.md`: wrap-shipped + deploy-health
  startup checks (#599).
- New register-only `communication.md` [base-communication] — comms
  defaults + shorthand verbs, framed as override-friendly, 0 chains
  (#602, closes #467).
- Genericity pass moved #493 to v2.19 (quality-gates-shaped, me-fuji-
  specific) and collapsed the 14 ai-workflow issues into 11 rules by
  merging pairs (#448+#483, #487+#488) and extending existing sections
  rather than adding parallel ones.

**Lesson:** dogfooding the lessons paid off mid-drain. #503 (arc42
authoring conventions) closed as already-covered once I opened `docs.md`
and found the `docs-arc42` section already held every proposed rule —
exactly the "verify a plan-time placement against the real file" rule
(#576) that landed in the same milestone. Its two genuinely-uncovered
side-patterns were preserved as #600/#601 rather than lost on close.

**PRs merged:** #593, #594, #595, #596, #597, #598, #599, #602

**Issues closed:** #454, #448, #483, #427, #488, #504, #487, #495, #520, #453, #576,
#463, #449, #575, #461, #517, #462, #325, #467. Also: #503 closed as already-covered;
#493 moved to v2.19; #600/#601 filed.

## 2026-06-25 — v2.19 Quality, testing & maintainability lessons

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Drained v2.19 in 9 PRs / 21 issues. `quality.md` (core, 30 chains)
  landed in 3 PRs: measurement & generation discipline — thresholds from
  distributions, mechanical-migration probe, emit-clean-at-source (#605:
  #469 #464 #428); maintainability — per-config opt-in, byte-equivalent
  ports, mega-script decomposition, extraction-ready modules (#606: #451
  #436 #345 #332); fail-loud + retract-dead-code (#607: #452 #476).
- `testing.md` (#608): verify-the-fix-fires-on-real-data, identical-
  metrics-smoking-gun, in-process UI e2e, production-data unit smoke
  (#475 #455 #523 #592). `360.md` (#609): headless-product perspective
  projection + audit-storage choice (#519 #337). `quality-gates.md`
  (#610): promote-a-resistant-case-to-a-gated-tier (#491).
  `data-quality.md` (#611): explicit-absence-over-invented-values +
  agent-assisted GT validation (#473 #432). `ai-workflow.md` (#612):
  folded schema-vs-ingestion split into the existing Middle-scope lesson
  (#440).
- Capstone #591 (#613): the *outbound* genericity sweep complementing
  the v2.17 inbound drain convention — neutralized optical/MTF domain
  nouns that predated it in core-tier + multi-chain templates
  (quality-gates worked example, quality/readme/docs examples).
- Released v2.18.0 mid-session (8 PRs / 19 issues) and flagged the stale
  PLAYBOOK release section vs ADR-006 → filed #604.

**Decisions:**
- **#493** (moved in from v2.18): part 4 (tiered-fixture promotion)
  landed merged with #491; part 3 (dual-path audit) already covered by
  existing audit-every-downstream-render + shared-path-breadth rules;
  parts 1–2 (probe-stopping, narrow-override) DEMOTED as single-use
  me-fuji-shaped — below the genericity bar.
- **#592**'s smoke-check AC declined: prose guidance is not a
  mechanically-checkable output constraint per `quality-gates-pair-check`;
  a section-presence check would be brittle.
- **#440** folded into #463's Middle-scope lesson rather than templated
  as a parallel rule.

**Lesson:** the genericity bar cut both ways this milestone — inbound
(#493 parts 1–2 demoted as single-use) and outbound (#591 neutralized
domain nouns that predated the convention). Same bar, two directions;
the capstone closes the loop the v2.17 PLAYBOOK convention opened.

**PRs merged:** #605, #606, #607, #608, #609, #610, #611, #612, #613

**Issues closed:** #469, #464, #428, #451, #436, #345, #332, #452, #476, #475, #455,
#523, #592, #519, #337, #491, #493, #473, #432, #440, #591. Filed #600, #601, #604
(Backlog).

## 2026-06-25 — v2.20 Concrete Python & frontend

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Drained v2.20 — the third and last pre-restructure milestone — in 5 PRs
  / 7 issues. These were concrete stack patterns, not lessons.
- Python: `python-lib.md` editable-install version-staleness gotcha + a
  build gate (`twine check dist/*`) (#518 #511, PR #619 — regen 7 Python
  chains, python-lib being their base); `python-service.md` runtime-version
  pinning across image/CI/mypy/`requires-python` (#530, #620);
  `python-flask.md` versioned-API registry + factory over per-version
  duplication (#512, #621).
- Frontend: `ux.md` graded-variant bake-off (#514, #622); frontend SEO —
  AEO rules (passage-first content, citation-frequency measurement,
  answer-engine crawler allowlist, FAQPage) plus #311's social-meta /
  heading-coherence / favicon rules, landed in the already-wired
  `quality.md` + `static-site.md` SEO sections (#490 #311, #623).

**Decision:** #311 asked for a new `frontend/seo.md` template. Landed its
rules now in the existing wired SEO sections (so they reach frontend
projects) and deferred the dedicated-file consolidation to the v3.0
frontend restructure — filed #624, pairs with #492. Creating a new
frontend file days before that restructure would only be moved again.

**Lesson:** stack-specific patterns belong in stack templates, not core.
The v2.17/#591 genericity bar guards the inverse direction (no one-stack
content in core), so concrete Python/frontend patterns landing in
`python-*.md` / `frontend/*.md` is exactly right — no demotion needed.

**Milestone arc:** v2.18 → v2.19 → v2.20 complete. The three-milestone
pre-restructure backlog drain is done; Backlog is down to single digits;
v3.0 — Restructure is the clear next milestone.

**PRs merged:** #619, #620, #621, #622, #623

**Issues closed:** #518, #511, #530, #512, #514, #490, #311. Filed #624 (v3.0
frontend/seo.md consolidation).

## 2026-06-26 — v2.21 Workflow, doc & data lessons + journal-ordering revert

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Triaged the four unmilestoned wuseria S188–189 lessons: created the
  v2.21 milestone for the three reusable ones (#615, #616, #617); #618
  (journal-format deviation) parked in v3.0 as the configurable-format
  question rather than closed.
- Reverted the dev-journal ordering mandate from newest-first back to
  chronological (oldest-first) — `docs.md`, the 30 generated chains, and
  this repo's own 36-entry journal reordered; recorded in ADR-015 (#618
  ordering half, PR #626). The newest-first flip had been an unexplained
  side effect of #500 / PR #543.
- Drained v2.21 in three one-concern PRs: #615 read the prior spike's
  close-out before re-investigating (`ai-workflow.md`, PR #627); #616 a
  comment citing an issue inherits its lifecycle (`quality.md` Code
  style, PR #628); #617 honest absence beats a recovered wrong value
  (`quality.md` Calibration discipline, PR #629).

**Decision:** ADR-015 settles dev-journal ordering as oldest-first with no
per-project configurability — a single default keeps generated context
files uniform. The flip was reverted because it carried no recorded
rationale and forced long-running downstream journals to either rewrite
history or carry a standing deviation.

**Lesson:** a convention changed without an ADR is indistinguishable from
drift — the newest-first flip rode inside an unrelated casing/schema PR
and could not be defended when challenged. Reversible convention changes
still need a recorded reason.

**Milestone arc:** v2.21 closes the pre-restructure lesson queue (now
empty). v3.0 — Restructure is the clear next milestone, spike-driven
(#179 inline→reference, #180 slim stacks, #350 viability audit).

**PRs merged:** #626, #627, #628, #629

**Issues closed:** #615, #616, #617. Created milestone v2.21; #618 parked in v3.0.

## 2026-06-26 — v2.22 restructure-safe cleanup (release docs, CD & API)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Cut a clean, restructure-safe v2.22.0 from the Backlog before opening
  v3.0 — three one-concern PRs, each independent of the inline→reference
  decisions (#179/#180/#350), so none is invalidated by the restructure.
- #604 aligned the PLAYBOOK "Release a new version" section with ADR-006:
  cut a GitHub Release from main with a bare-version title and
  `--generate-notes`, close the milestone, journal entry via its own
  no-milestone `docs(journal)` PR (PR #631). Dropped the abandoned
  `chore/release` branch+PR flow, which only applies to manifest projects.
- #601 added a build-once/deploy-via-hook CD rule to `cicd.md`: after
  publishing, trigger the deploy by sending the artifact's immutable
  reference to the deploy target, never rebuilding at deploy time
  (PR #632, +16 regenerated chains).
- #600 extended the `api.md` OpenAPI section with the design-first
  source-of-truth pattern — hand-authored spec served verbatim, pinned
  to code, contract-tested (e.g. Schemathesis); fastapi/flask keep their
  framework-native code-first OpenAPI (PR #633, +5 chains).

**Decision:** held #581 (refresh example CLAUDE.md files) out of v2.22 —
it depends on the examples-maintenance model (spike #13, in v3.0), and the
inline→reference flip would change what an example should even look like.
Refreshing now risks throwaway work.

**Lesson:** a downstream pattern (build-once/deploy-hook, design-first
OpenAPI) often overlaps an existing template rule — extend the existing
section and reference the shared principle rather than add a parallel one,
or the restated rule becomes attention dilution.

**Milestone arc:** v2.22 is the last pre-restructure release — a stable,
clean v2.x baseline. v3.0 — Restructure is next, spike-driven (#179
inline→reference, #180 slim stacks, #350 viability audit).

**PRs merged:** #631, #632, #633

**Issues closed:** #604, #601, #600. Created and closed milestone v2.22.0.

## 2026-06-26 — v2.23 Examples (ADR-016 + full regeneration)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Added a v2.23 — Examples milestone before v3.0 to land the examples
  work as its own point release. Pulled spike #13 in from v3.0 (it gates
  #581) and pushed #90 (launch) and #369 (cold-start, blocked on #368)
  into v3.0, emptying the Backlog milestone.
- #13 → ADR-016: example `CLAUDE.md` files are agent-generated outputs of
  the documented local-agent path — regenerated on material template
  change, never hand-patched. `generated/` stays the authoritative
  deterministic chain reference; structure is gated by smoke (PR #635).
- #581: regenerated all 8 examples via the pipeline (existing brief +
  `generated/<stack>.md` + `agents.md`). Seven moved from the stale
  pre-`agents.md` free-form shape to the six-section inline model, adding
  §5 Review process and §6 Session protocol with a compliant §6.3;
  hybrid-astro stayed on the hybrid model with its duplicate §1.3 fixed.
  Disambiguated the two same-named Go examples: go-service → MetricStream
  (chi), metricshub kept MetricsHub (Echo). Added a PLAYBOOK "Regenerate
  an example" procedure and a CLAUDE.md §2.5 pointer (PR #636).

**Decision:** reversed v2.22's deferral of #581. v2.22 held it back
fearing the inline→reference flip (#179) would make a refresh throwaway.
This session resolved that: the six-section skeleton is stable across
inline→reference — only section *bodies* change — so regenerating onto
the skeleton now is durable. v2.23 is now the last pre-restructure
release; v3.0 — Restructure is next.

**Lesson:** when a deferral rests on "an upcoming change will redo this,"
check whether that change touches the *structure* you would produce or
only its *content*. A stable skeleton means the work is not throwaway,
and the deferral is unjustified.

**Template feedback:** ADR-016 and the "Regenerate an example" procedure
are project-specific (they govern this repo's `examples/`). No upstream
template change.

**PRs merged:** #635, #636

**Issues closed:** #13, #581. Created and closed milestone v2.23.0;
moved #90 and #369 to v3.0.

## 2026-06-26 — v2.24 Stack structure (ADR-017 + drift + SYS-06)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Opened v2.24 — Stack structure as consolidation pre-work before the
  stack-cleanup spike/removals (Milestone B): a consistent baseline makes
  stacks comparable before any are cut.
- #639 → ADR-017: canonical stack-template section structure. MUST (Stack,
  Commands, Project structure), SHOULD (Testing, `<Language> conventions`,
  Git, Configuration, Quality gates, Error handling), MAY (domain).
  Membership judged on the resolved chain (inheritance counts); pure
  libraries exempt from Project structure; canonical order fixed; names
  SYS-06 as the gate (PR #642).
- #640: fixed the drift — added Project structure to htmx and
  static-site-astro, renamed terraform's "Repository structure" to the
  canonical name; added Testing to static-site-astro (cross-referencing
  its Quality gates table) and static-site-hugo (build/link/Lighthouse/
  a11y); renamed language sections to `<Language> conventions` (python-lib,
  c-embedded, rust-lib, iac-terraform) (PR #643).
- #641: SYS-06 smoke gate — resolved-chain MUST sections, library-exempt;
  spec `SAIT-SMK-SYS-06-001A` + INDEX row; smoke now 20 checks (PR #644).

**Decision:** gate on the RESOLVED CHAIN, not the raw file. A derived
stack may satisfy a MUST section via its parent, so the gate must not
force repetition — that keeps the composition model intact.

**Lesson:** audit "drift" against the resolved chain, not file-by-file.
Several apparent gaps dissolved on inspection — python-service inherits
Commands from python-lib, terraform had the structure under a different
heading — and one originally-planned fix (adding python-service Commands)
would have introduced a duplicate section downstream. Simulate the gate
before writing the fixes.

**Template feedback:** ADR-017 and SYS-06 are project-specific (they
govern this repo's stack templates). The MUST/SHOULD/MAY taxonomy and
`<Language> conventions` naming are reusable authoring conventions but
live in ADR-017, not a template.

**PRs merged:** #642, #643, #644

**Issues closed:** #639, #640, #641. Created and closed milestone
v2.24.0. Next: Milestone B — spike on whether to cut low-value stacks,
then the removals.

## 2026-06-26 — v2.25 Stack cleanup (remove java, terraform, rust)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Milestone B — v2.25 — Stack cleanup, realizing #180 (slim the supported
  stacks). The v2.24 structure baseline made stacks comparable first.
- Spike (#180): decided to remove the java, terraform, and rust stacks —
  owner has never used them and does not plan to. All four are leaf stacks
  with zero dependents, so removal breaks no resolved chain.
- #646: removed java-spring-boot, java-grpc, iac-terraform, rust-lib
  (templates + generated chains + manifest entries), the rust-lib e2e case
  (STK-19 retired), and the java-/iac-/rust- rows from CLAUDE.md §2.3.
  Repointed the hybrid-deployment test (DPL-02) onto go-service to keep
  that coverage. sync.py regenerated the README/SPEC/INTERVIEW tables.
  Stacks 30 → 26 (PR #647).

**Decision:** remove rather than keep — the provenance principle (ADR-011,
"forged in real work") argues against shipping stacks the owner never used
or validated. Breadth is not worth carrying unvalidated, maintenance-bearing
templates.

**Lesson:** scope a removal by checking dependents on the resolved chain,
not by name — all four were leaves, so the blast radius was just their own
files plus auto-regenerated tables. Preserve incidental coverage by
repointing (DPL-02 → go-service), not deleting, when a test merely used a
removed stack as a carrier.

**Template feedback:** the slimming criterion (keep only stacks actually
used/validated) is project governance — ADR-011 applied to whole stacks,
not a reusable template rule.

**PRs merged:** #647

**Issues closed:** #646, #180. Created and closed milestone v2.25.0.

## 2026-06-26 — v2.26 Stack cleanup round 2 + markdownlint config

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Milestone v2.26 — Stack cleanup (round 2), same provenance rationale
  (ADR-011) as v2.25.
- #650: added `.markdownlint.json` matching the template house style —
  disables MD022/031/032/040/060 (heading/list/fence/table-style) and
  keeps MD013 <80 for prose. markdownlint is not in CI, so it only quiets
  the editor (PR #651; MD060 added in the removal PR when table-style
  noise surfaced).
- #649: removed 9 stacks — full-nextjs, full-sveltekit, mobile-flutter,
  mobile-react-native, spa-react, spa-vue, spa-svelte, static-site-hugo,
  python-celery-worker. Also dropped the orphaned mobile/ layer
  (mobile-auth, mobile-ux), the react-spa example, 5 e2e cases
  (STK-05/06/09/14/17 retired), and the smoke runner's mobile template
  dir. Stacks 26 → 17; frontend now = static-site-astro + htmx (PR #652).

**Decision:** cut a new v2.26.0 rather than move the published v2.25.0
tag. Published releases are immutable (ADR-006); moving a tag rewrites a
released artifact, the same hazard as a force-push.

**Lesson:** removing stacks orphans their *exclusive* layer templates
(mobile/) and leaves the smoke runner's `TEMPLATE_DIRS` pointing at a
deleted directory — sweep both. Check transitive reachability before
removing a layer template: frontend-ux/quality stayed because astro still
reaches them via frontend-static-site.

**Template feedback:** the removal is governance (provenance applied to
whole stacks); the markdownlint config documents the project's markdown
conventions — both project-specific, no reusable template change.

**PRs merged:** #651, #652

**Issues closed:** #649, #650. Created and closed milestone v2.26.0.

## 2026-06-26 — 360 audit + audit-storage convention lock

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Ran a full 360-degree audit using the headless adaptation of
  `base/workflow/360.md` (§360-headless): seven context-isolated
  subagents — Value / Viability / Discovery plus Quality re-projected
  into Architecture, Documentation, Authoring/ADR, and Testing/CI.
  Overall C+; bottleneck = a shipped resolver defect. Persisted at
  `docs/audits/2026-06-26-360.md`.
- Filed 12 actionable tickets (#654–#665) across new milestones v2.27
  (correctness), v2.28 (hygiene), and v3.0 (launch); milestoned and
  labelled the previously-orphaned #638.
- #666: adopted the dated-report audit convention — migrated the
  single-file `docs/360-audit.md` to `docs/audits/2026-05-04-360.md`,
  added the new report, fixed the journal pointer.
- #667: collapsed `360.md` §360-tracking to one convention (docs/audits
  only) and added a PLAYBOOK "Run a 360-degree audit" section.
- #668: ADR-018 (docs/audits is the sole audit location) + smoke SYS-07
  gate (no audit file outside docs/audits/, dated naming) + pair-the-check
  line in 360.md + spec SAIT-SMK-SYS-07-001A; backfilled the missing
  SYS-06 in CODIFICATION. Smoke 20 → 21.

**Decision:** lock the audit-storage convention three ways — ADR +
template/PLAYBOOK docs + a mechanical smoke gate — rather than
documentation alone, so it cannot drift back to the two-option ambiguity.

**Lesson:** the audit's highest-value finding (resolve.py dropping a
multi-line `depends_on`) was invisible to the 20-check smoke suite
because two divergent manifest parsers — PyYAML in smoke, hand-rolled in
resolve.py — were never reconciled. A green check suite can still ship a
broken artifact when the check and the tool do not share a code path.
Reproduce the crux finding directly before grading it.

**Template feedback:** the single-convention audit storage (§360-tracking)
and the headless 360 adaptation (§360-headless) are reusable — both live
upstream in `templates/base/workflow/360.md`. The SYS-07 check and
ADR-018 are project-specific tooling and governance.

**PRs merged:** #666, #667, #668

**Issues closed:** none. Created #654–#665 (+ milestoned #638) and
milestones v2.27, v2.28.

## 2026-06-26 — v2.27 Correctness & generation integrity

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- #654 (P1 bug): taught the stdlib-only manifest parsers in
  `resolve.py`/`sync.py` to read a bracketed `depends_on` continuation
  line. `frontend-static-site` was the only entry in that form, so its
  deps parsed empty — `stack-astro`/`stack-tutorial` had shipped with no
  security/CSS/UX/SEO rules (10 files, not 13). Regenerated both chains.
- #655 (P1): added smoke check MNF-05 — resolve every stack with both
  the hand-rolled parser and PyYAML and fail on any mismatch. Verified
  it fails on the pre-fix parser. Smoke 21 → 22.
- #656: removed the vestigial `"mobile"` manifest section (dead since
  v2.26) from the iteration tuples in `resolve.py` and `run_smoke.py`.
- #657: repointed `SAIT-E2E-STK-07-001A`'s retired STK-06 cross-ref to
  STK-20, and dropped three phantom `FMT-03/04/05` rows from
  `tests/INDEX.md` (no spec file, no case).
- #658: named `data-governance`/`data-migration` as intentional opt-in
  orphans in SPEC's Orthogonal-templates list (both reached by zero
  chains; `data-quality` is the only chain-reached data module).

**Decision:** fix #654 by teaching the regex parser (keeping `tools/`
import-free) rather than unifying on PyYAML, then close the
two-parser fragility *mechanically* with MNF-05 rather than collapsing
to one parser — the reconciliation gate is stronger than a single
parser, which could still diverge from YAML semantics on another edge.

**Lesson:** a self-consistency check cannot catch a wrong artifact when
it regenerates from the same broken code — `resolve.py --check` validated
`generated/` against the very parser that produced the defect and
reported "up to date." A correctness gate must compare against an
independent reference (here, PyYAML), and you must prove it fails on the
broken input before trusting it green.

**Template feedback:** the parser fix and the MNF-05 gate are
project-specific tooling — no upstream template. The reusable principle
(gate two implementations against a reference oracle, and prove the gate
red before trusting it green) is a testing discipline, not a template
rule; left in this journal, not added to a template file.

**PRs merged:** #670, #671, #672, #673, #674

**Issues closed:** #654, #655, #656, #657, #658. Released v2.27.0 and
closed milestone v2.27.

## 2026-06-26 — v2.28 Authoring & test hygiene

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- #660 (PR #676): renamed go-lib's idiom section "Code quality" →
  "Go conventions" (ID go-lib-conventions) per ADR-017 clause 5; all four
  Go chains inherit it.
- #659 (PR #677): reflowed 136 prose lines <80 via a content-preserving
  splitter (one space → newline per break, non-whitespace content
  asserted unchanged per file); documented the §2.7 exemption for table
  rows, fenced code, single-line `[DEPENDS ON:]`, and unbreakable
  URL/link tokens.
- #638 (PR #678): scope.md handoff-breadcrumb rule now requires the
  wrap-up writer to validate each candidate against the tracker and drop
  closed/out-of-milestone ones before listing.
- #663 (PR #679): regenerated the hybrid-astro example via the ADR-016
  pipeline — flattened submodule paths corrected to the resolvable
  `docs/solid-ai-templates/templates/base/core/quality.md` form (all 12
  resolve).
- #661 (PR #680): added e2e cases STK-21 (nestjs), STK-22 (c-embedded),
  STK-23 (tutorial) + specs/INDEX/CODIFICATION; STK coverage 14→17.
- #662 (PR #681): smoke SYS-08 locks in the 7 example→stack pairs (each
  example must keep a non-empty CLAUDE.md mapped to a real stack). Smoke
  22 → 23.

**Decision:** lock the example set at the existing 7 (gate by example→
stack, two map to astro and two to fastapi) rather than requiring an
example for every concrete stack — the latter would force ~8 new
agent-generated examples, its own effort. New examples opt into the gate
by registering in REQUIRED_EXAMPLES.

**Lesson:** a bulk content reflow over reference docs is safe to automate
*iff* the transform is whitespace-only and you assert it — comparing the
non-whitespace content before/after per file turns "did I corrupt a
rule?" from a manual review into a guarantee. Pair any mechanical sweep
with that invariant before trusting it.

**Template feedback:** the "Go conventions" rename (#660), the §2.7
line-length exemptions (#659), and the scope.md handoff-validation rule
(#638) are reusable and live upstream in `templates/`. The reflow
splitter, SYS-08 gate, and the three e2e cases are project tooling/tests.

**PRs merged:** #676, #677, #678, #679, #680, #681

**Issues closed:** #659, #660, #661, #662, #663, #638. Released v2.28.0
and closed milestone v2.28.

## 2026-06-27 — Redundancy audit & CI ratchet

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Session opened exploring authoring/review skills (`write-template`,
  `review-template`) under `.claude/skills/` — kept local, never
  committed, then removed once we judged `write-template` redundant with
  always-loaded context. Running the review on the core tier is what
  surfaced the redundancy that became the focus.
- #683 (PR #684): trimmed base-quality's Testability and Testing
  sections that restated rules owned by base-testing — every chain
  loaded both.
- #685 (PR #686): removed the migration-commit rule restated by
  python-flask/fastapi/django; they inherit it from python-service.
- #687 (PR #688): added `tools/audit_redundancy.py` — override-aware
  in-chain duplicate detector (exact + `--near`); PLAYBOOK "Audit
  redundancy" + CLAUDE.md §1.3 commands.
- #689 (PR #690): corrected the Python Stack override graph
  (python-service-stack overrides python-lib-stack; framework stacks
  override python-service-stack — the abstract Stack was leaking into
  every chain) and removed the app-logging rule from go-lib (owned by
  backend-observability; standalone go-lib drops it, service chains
  keep it). Audit 6 → 2.
- #691 (PR #692): `BASELINE` allowlist + wired `audit_redundancy.py
  --check` into CI as a ratchet (fail on new exact dups only).
- #693 (PR #694): cleared the last two frontend restatements (analytics,
  prettier); `BASELINE` emptied → true zero.

**Decision:** ADR-019 — detect on the resolved chain, exclude
override-superseded pairs, gate exact duplicates only, ratchet from a
baseline. #624's `frontend/seo.md` extraction stays deferred to the
restructure under #492 (commented, kept open).

**Lesson:** a duplicate-detection gate over a composition system MUST
model the override graph or it cries wolf on legitimate replacement —
the throwaway probe over-reported the Go Stack sections; the
productionized tool excludes `[OVERRIDE]`-superseded pairs (transitively)
and the false positives vanished. Validate a new lint's signal against
real findings first, and introduce it as a baseline ratchet, not a
zero-gate.

**Template feedback:** the Python override-graph correction (#689) and
the go-lib app-logging removal are reusable template fixes (live in
`templates/`). The audit tool, `BASELINE`, and the CI gate are project
tooling/infra; the audit-then-baseline-ratchet sequence is a reusable
process for introducing a content-quality gate.

**PRs merged:** #684, #686, #688, #690, #692, #694

**Issues closed:** #683, #685, #687, #689, #691, #693. #624 commented
(seo.md extraction deferred to #492); journal/ADR PR carries no
milestone.

## 2026-06-27 — Wiki: patterns→wiki rename, cleanup, backend article

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context).

Cosmetic-then-substantive pass over the human-reference docs: renamed
the `patterns/` folder to `wiki/` and grew it with a backend primer.

- #696: renamed `docs/patterns/` → `docs/wiki/` ("gathers knowledge");
  swept the 5 pages (titles, lead text, all `[ID]` tags → wiki framing)
  and fixed stale `base/*-patterns.md` cross-links; updated the SPEC
  Wiki section. Also removed SPEC's never-implemented `Resolution: full
  (rules + patterns)` mode and its companion `*-patterns.md` step —
  drift that contradicted ADR-004 (patterns are human reference, not in
  the manifest or agent context).
- #697: stripped the vestigial template machinery the pages carried
  from their old life as `base/*-patterns.md` templates — all 50
  `[ID]`/`[DEPENDS ON]` tags — and trimmed per-section dividers (8 → 1
  per page). Confirmed: not in the manifest, never resolved, never
  scanned by smoke.
- #699: added `docs/wiki/backend.md` — a concept-first primer (what a
  backend is, API styles, building blocks, composing for requirements,
  reference compositions). Folded the `imbra-ltd/nango-blogs`
  webhook-floods post in as a building-block composition ("inbound
  webhooks under load"), vendor-neutral — product marketing stripped.
- #700: filled §3 building-block gaps — Config/secrets, Feature flags,
  Analytics/warehouse, and load balancing + CDN on the edge row.

**Decision:** no new ADR. The rename is a label change and the SPEC
cleanup enacts ADR-004 (wiki pages are human reference, outside the
dependency graph) rather than deciding anything new.

**Lesson:** docs describing a never-built mechanism are drift, not
documentation — SPEC's `Resolution: full` could never differ from the
default once ADR-004 moved patterns out of the manifest. And a "new
topic" (webhook floods) is often just a composition of existing blocks
(queue, DLQ, dedup, debounce, fairness); framing it that way keeps a
primer coherent and avoids redundancy with the rules templates.

**Template feedback:** all changes are project-specific to `docs/wiki/`
(human reference). The webhook-flood defenses already live in
`templates/backend/webhooks.md` (which delegates DLQ/debounce/fairness
to `messaging.md`), so no template change was needed — the wiki article
only cross-references them.

**PRs merged:** #696, #697, #699, #700

**Issues closed:** none (ad-hoc session); none created. Journal PR
carries no milestone.

## 2026-07-05 — v2.29 Generation coherence

**Tool:** Claude Code (Fable 5).

Triaged the 16 unmilestoned issues (labels + Backlog/v3.0 split), then
planned and shipped v2.29 — four fixes where the generated output
contradicted itself or its own rules:

- #708: promoted `base-review` into the `core:` tier (now six
  templates). It was registered but reachable by no chain while the
  agents.md §5 skeleton universally hardcoded review.md — the review
  process was unreachable through the dependency graph. SPEC orthogonal
  set updated; all 17 chains regenerated. The base-oop reach question
  split out to #727.
- #710: agents.md said "omit section 4 for a backend service" while all
  four service examples keep the placeholder. Convention now matches
  the examples: top-level sections 1–6 are role-fixed; a non-applicable
  section keeps its heading with a one-line `Not applicable — <reason>`
  body; only subsections may be omitted.
- #716: reconciled README-as-SSOT with the Project-structure section
  requirement (ADR-020): README owns the directory map; the generated
  section is a pointer to README plus agent-facing placement rules,
  never a second tree; stack templates keep layout sections as
  generation-time input. Examples realign at the next regeneration
  (#709).
- #713: base-readme §4 now permits the structure as an indented tree or
  a two-column `Path` | `Purpose` table (validated downstream in
  demo-sensor-app).

**Decision:** ADR-020 — README owns the directory map
(`docs/decisions/020-structure-section-ownership.md`).

**Lesson:** a skeleton that hardcodes a template path is an implicit
dependency the manifest cannot see — anything the output format
references universally must be in the core tier, or generation quietly
severs it. Coherence bugs surface downstream first: three of the four
fixes were reported from consuming projects (demo-sensor-app).

**Template feedback:** all four changes ARE template changes — nothing
project-specific to feed upstream this session.

**PRs merged:** #726, #728, #729, #730

**Issues closed:** #708, #710, #713, #716. Created: #727 (base-oop
reach, Backlog). Journal PR carries no milestone.

## 2026-07-05 — v2.30 Downstream lessons

**Tool:** Claude Code (Fable 5).

Second milestone of the day (after v2.29): drained the
downstream-evidence batch from the Backlog — seven template
refinements fed back from corrosim, wuseria, and demo-sensor-app,
shipped as five PRs:

- #704 + #720: hardened `quality-gates-scope-agreement` with the
  formatter-vs-generator escalation (ignore entry + `--check` gate +
  same-PR landing, from wuseria #1336) and the always-run-job rule
  for mirroring cross-cutting deterministic checks (path filters are
  enumeration-fragile; from a docs-only PR that broke a main deploy).
- #722: new `quality-gates-complexity` section — gate cognitive
  complexity (complexipy / sonarjs), retrofit via a committed ratchet
  baseline; the what-NOT-to-gate McCabe bullet now points there
  (corrosim ADR 0013: the two metrics measurably disagree).
- #723: new `quality-gates-tree-audit` section — dup/dead-code
  detectors are a documented periodic whole-tree audit at epic/release
  boundaries, not a per-PR gate; diff-scoped review cannot see the
  twin of a pasted block (corrosim PLAYBOOK 3.8).
- #718: bidirectional-artifact caveat under git.md's regenerate rule —
  an artifact an `--apply` step reads back into the source is ground
  truth; auto-regenerating it overwrites human-verified values
  (wuseria S201).
- #719: python-lib src/ adoption must audit path-based excludes for
  package-dir collisions and anchor them (corrosim: bandit silently
  dropped src/corrosim/report/ — 2357 vs 4312 LOC scanned, CI green).
- #721: platform/github retry pattern for transient `uses:` steps —
  continue-on-error + outcome-gated (not conclusion) conditional
  retry, fail-loud second attempt, infra steps only (wuseria ADR-077).

**Decision:** no new ADR — all changes are rule additions inside
existing template sections; nothing structural.

**Lesson:** the Backlog batch pattern works — seven issues from three
downstream projects composed into one themed milestone with zero
scope collisions. Downstream incident reports that name the exact
section they refine (`quality-gates-scope-agreement`) are the
cheapest template improvements to land.

**Template feedback:** all seven changes ARE template changes
distilled from downstream projects — the feedback loop working as
designed.

**PRs merged:** #732, #733, #734, #735, #736, #737

**Issues closed:** #704, #718, #719, #720, #721, #722, #723; none
created. Journal PR carries no milestone.

## 2026-07-10 — v2.31 CI & test hardening

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8 [1M]).

Groomed the post-v2.30 downstream-lessons backlog — 36 unmilestoned
issues labeled, clustered by target file, and milestoned; #749 closed
as a duplicate of #753. Then cut v2.31 from the ready subset: ten
self-contained CI, security, and test-hardening rule additions to
chain-reaching template files, shipped one concern per PR (#776–#785).

- #751 (#776): pair the LF MUST in `quality.md` with a `.gitattributes`
  mechanism (`* text=auto` / `eol=lf`) — EditorConfig normalizes
  editor-side, `.gitattributes` is the git-side commit/checkout
  guarantee; names `git ls-files --eol` as the check (corrosim CRLF
  churn).
- #756 (#777): scope the coverage denominator to the CI-runnable
  surface — omit genuinely un-runnable modules (native / GPU /
  container-only) and validate them out-of-band; the omit-list is a
  reviewable contract, the coverage analogue of the complexity ratchet.
- #754 (#778): new in-process config model in `config.md` — frozen
  preset object + name registry + unset-means-default resolver;
  composes with 12-factor env rather than replacing it.
- #758 (#779): AST meta-test for the public-API annotation + docstring
  contract in `testing.md` — the linter owns format, a test owns
  presence on the public surface only, adopted behind a module
  allowlist.
- #763 (#780): drift-guard meta-tests in `testing.md` — any fact stored
  twice gets an introspection test that fails on divergence
  (constant-vs-contract, route coverage, version parity).
- #759 (#781): secret scanning MUST cover full git history
  (`fetch-depth: 0`) in `devsecops.md` + `platform/github.md` — a
  deleted secret persists in old commits, so a shallow scan is false
  safety.
- #762 (#782): split scanning by actionability in `devsecops.md` — gate
  on owned deps, inform on unfixable base-layer CVEs; reconciled the
  `containers.md` push rule to "no **fixable** high/critical".
- #768 (#783): runtime version coherence in `containers.md` — base
  image, CI, type-checker target, and packaging floor pin ONE runtime;
  move them together so a base-only bump can't ship an untested runtime.
- #769 (#784): fan-in gate mechanism in `platform/github.md` — one gate
  per job + a single `always()` fan-in as the sole required context,
  failing unless every result is exactly `success` (skipped / cancelled
  count as failure); the encoding the `quality-gates` "skipped is not
  passed" rule demanded.
- #770 (#785): least-privilege workflow permissions in
  `platform/github.md` — `contents: read` default, job-scoped writes,
  SAST's `security-events: write` isolated in its own workflow.

**Decision:** no new ADR — all ten are rule additions inside existing
template sections; nothing structural. Milestone named for its content
("CI & test hardening"), not a round number.

**Lesson:** groom-then-drain scales — a 36-issue downstream batch
triaged into a ready ten-issue themed milestone (self-contained edits
to chain-reaching files) while new-file and reference-only-doc
(`ai-workflow.md`) issues stayed parked for v3.0. Sequential
one-concern PRs kept the `generated/` regen honest per change.

**Template feedback:** all ten are template changes distilled from
downstream evidence (corrosim et al.) — reusable upstream content, the
feedback loop as designed.

**PRs merged:** #776, #777, #778, #779, #780, #781, #782, #783, #784, #785

**Issues closed:** #751, #754, #756, #758, #759, #762, #763, #768, #769, #770;
plus #749 as a duplicate of #753 during grooming. Journal PR carries no
milestone.

## 2026-07-10 — v2.32 Testing & authoring discipline

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8 [1M]).

Third milestone of the day (after v2.31): a themed subset of the same
downstream backlog — ten self-contained testing-depth and
authoring-discipline rule additions to existing core/base files, one
concern per PR (#787–#796). Scope confirmed before the cut; new-file and
reference-only-doc issues stayed parked for v3.0.

- #739 (#787): `oop.md` gains a "When not to reach for a class"
  counterweight — prefer free functions for stateless logic, treat a
  `run()`-only class as a function in disguise, put behaviour on the
  state that owns it. The file was all pro-OOP, biasing toward
  over-abstraction.
- #740 (#788): characterization-fingerprint refactor proof in
  `testing.md` — hash the full-precision output before, regenerate and
  diff after; seed nondeterminism; keep the hash disposable (a committed
  platform-dependent hash goes CI-flaky — commit invariants instead).
- #764 (#789): serve the real app in-process on an ephemeral port (bind
  0 in a daemon thread) — the lightweight middle between the framework
  test client and a container; one helper for driver scripts and
  browser UI tests.
- #765 (#790): runtime-agnostic, health-gated container e2e — drive via
  a Docker-API-compatible library (Docker/Podman via `DOCKER_HOST`),
  poll-not-sleep, import-guard the optional dep, disable the rootless
  reaper.
- #774 (#791): derive the test tier from the directory with one
  collection hook (a marker can't drift from where the test sits) and
  default the run to the fast tier, heavy tier opt-in.
- #741 (#792): `docs.md` — a per-field generator MUST derive its field
  enumeration from the data schema, never a hardcoded list; dead columns
  are the visible tell of the silent-omission failure (wuseria S206).
- #742 (#793): `docs.md` round-trip rule — a refresh of a
  scaffold-plus-human-edits file MUST preserve human content or fail
  loud naming what it would discard; silent revert is data loss
  (wuseria S207).
- #744 (#794): de-circularization sweep in `quality.md` calibration
  discipline — when a reference set flips from tool-seeded to verified,
  grep for comments/guards/thresholds citing the old data and re-verify
  in the same change (wuseria S209).
- #745 (#795): forbid ticket/PR/ADR *numbers* in code comments and
  docstrings (markdown docs still cross-ref by number); scientific
  source names are the exception; grep test named as enforcement
  (corrosim #151).
- #746 (#796): warn in `git.md` that a `close/fix/resolve #N` keyword
  auto-closes even inside a negation ("does not close #N" still closes
  it) — use "part of #N" instead (corrosim).

**Decision:** no new ADR — all ten are rule additions inside existing
template sections; nothing structural. Scope confirmed via a
themed-subset choice, not an autonomous cut, since a release is
outward-facing.

**Lesson:** two consecutive themed drains (v2.31 CI/security, v2.32
testing/authoring) came out of one 36-issue groom — theming by target
file at groom time makes each release a coherent, low-collision cut.
A chained `gh pr create && gh pr checks --watch` raced CI registration

## 2026-07-10 — v2.33 Backend correctness

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8 [1M]).

Fourth milestone of the day: the backend-layer subset of the same groom
— five request / response / concurrency correctness rules, one concern
per PR (#798–#802).

- #766 (#798): `security.md` — state the principle behind the existing
  `nosniff` MIME-pinning rule: with `nosniff` the browser will not
  correct a wrong `Content-Type`, so the server is the sole authority
  and MIME resolution must not depend on the host.
- #767 (#799): `concurrency.md` — prove statelessness with disjoint
  inputs: fire parallel requests with non-overlapping expected outputs
  and assert each response stays in its own set; a cross-request value
  exposes an accidental module-level mutable a same-input test can't.
- #772 (#800): `api.md` — the contract document's own version
  (OpenAPI `info.version`) is a separate axis from the package/release
  version; don't bump it on a package patch that doesn't touch the
  contract, and a drift test asserts the field present, not equal.
- #773 (#801): `http.md` — parse typed query params explicitly to
  distinguish absent / valid / present-but-invalid (400), not a
  coercing helper that collapses invalid into a default-valued 200.
- #775 (#802): `http.md` — name the concrete `allow_nan=false` encoder
  flag on the existing reject-non-finite-floats rule.

**Decision:** no new ADR — all five are rule additions/refinements
inside existing template sections; nothing structural.

**Lesson:** two of the five (#766 nosniff MIME, #775 `NaN`/`Infinity`)
were already substantially in the templates from an earlier downstream
pass — the groom predated those additions. Grep the target file for
existing coverage BEFORE writing: both shipped as minimal
principle/example enhancements, not redundant bullets. A backlog groomed
weeks deep should expect some items overtaken by intervening work.

**Template feedback:** all five are template changes distilled from
downstream evidence — reusable upstream content.

## 2026-07-10 — v2.34 CI & deploy

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8 [1M]).

The last self-contained cut from the groom (v2.31–v2.34) — three
CI/deploy rules, one concern per PR (#804–#806).

- #771 (#804): `cicd.md` — a deploy step whose optional secret is absent
  on forks/contributor branches MUST skip and stay green, not hard-fail.
  The issue's other two refinements (deploy-the-published-artifact,
  tag-triggered production) were already present from #601 build-once CD
  and the triggers table — only skip-not-fail was missing.
- #752 (#805): `containers.md` — new Docker Compose section (Compose was
  absent from the whole tree): when warranted, the `build` / `run --rm`
  workflow, and bind-mount-for-local-dev-only versus image-is-the-
  artifact in CI/prod. Kept MAY/SHOULD.
- #743 (#806): `platform/github.md` — refine the retry bullet to
  distinguish single-hit flake / multi-minute flake / sustained outage,
  naming a bounded 3-attempt growing-backoff escalation for the middle
  class with a reclassify stop condition (wuseria ADR-078).

**Decision:** no new ADR — rule additions/refinements inside existing
sections; the Compose section is new content in an existing file.

**Lesson:** the drainable backlog is now exhausted. One 36-issue groom
produced four themed minor releases (v2.31 CI/security, v2.32
testing/authoring, v2.33 backend, v2.34 CI/deploy) plus a duplicate
close — theming by target file at groom time is what let each cut land
coherently. The remaining 8 Backlog issues ALL require v3.0 groundwork
(new files `python.md` #753 / `cli.md` #755 and their dependents, and
reference-only-doc placements blocked on the #179 inline→ref
restructure); no further self-contained minor is possible without it.

**Template feedback:** all three are template changes distilled from
downstream evidence — reusable upstream content.

**Issues closed:** #743, #752, #771. Journal PR carries no milestone.

## 2026-07-10 — v2.35 Discipline refinements

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8 [1M]).

A fifth themed minor from the groom, recovered after re-checking the
"exhausted backlog" claim made at v2.34 — three issues parked as
v3.0-blocked were actually self-contained. One concern per PR
(#808–#810).

- #761 (#808): `scope.md` — strengthen the End-of-session template-
  feedback item on three axes: capture the reusability verdict at
  decision time (on the ADR, robust to sessions that never wrap), strip
  the domain skin before judging, reconcile the whole convention set
  periodically. The meta-fix behind the #749–#760 batches, which had to
  be surfaced by a deliberate later gap-analysis instead of firing.
- #760 (#809): `python-lib.md` — reconcile the flat `mypy --strict`
  mandate with a staged adoption path (non-strict + `ignore_missing_imports`
  → tighten per module toward strict) and quarantining untyped deps with
  a per-module override plus a stated reason.
- #747 (#810): `docs.md` — a provenance/justification-doc backfill is a
  data audit: cross-check each stored value against its cited source,
  surface a gap rather than encode a false "not tested" marker,
  distinguishing source-silent from source-has-data-but-unpopulated.

**Decision:** no new ADR — rule additions/refinements inside existing
sections.

**Lesson:** the "drainable backlog exhausted" call at v2.34 was wrong. I
parked #747/#760/#761 as v3.0-blocked from the issue titles' file names,
assuming reference-only or new-file dependence. Verifying each target
against the resolved chains with `resolve.py` (scope.md IS in
stack-tutorial; python-lib.md and docs.md are in-chain) recovered a
fifth cut. Verify chain membership before declaring an item blocked —
not from the filename in the title.

**Template feedback:** all three are template changes distilled from
downstream evidence — reusable upstream content.

## 2026-07-12 — Annotated release tags (incident #812)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 4.8 [1M]).

Incident triaged out of Expedite: 30 of 37 release tags were lightweight
(`git tag`), which `git describe` skips — a downstream submodule pinned at
`v2.35.0` reported `v2.17.0-128-g6969ccd`. Root cause was in the templates
themselves: the version-manifest release flow in `git.md` and
`static-site-tutorial.md` used plain `git tag`, and the no-build flow used
`git tag -a` with no rationale, so operators "simplified" the `-a` away.

- #812 (#813): `git.md` — both release flows now mandate `git tag -a`
  with an inline rationale (a lightweight tag is invisible to
  `git describe`); `static-site-tutorial.md` fixed the same way; new
  `.github/workflows/tag-guard.yml` fails CI when a pushed `v*` tag is
  lightweight; regenerated the 17 `generated/` chains (base-git is core).
- Retagged all 30 historical lightweight tags as annotated at their
  original commits — `git describe 6969ccd` now returns `v2.35.0` exactly;
  37 annotated / 0 lightweight.

**Decision:** no new ADR — the annotated-tag requirement and its rationale
live in the `git.md` template; ADR-006 (release process) stands unchanged.

**Lesson:** `git push --force` is blocked by the harness even for tags. The
fallback delete+re-push detaches a tag's GitHub Release to a draft (restore
per-tag with `gh release edit --draft=false`); updating the tag ref in
place is preferable, as it keeps Releases published.

**Template feedback:** reusable — the fix lives in the `base-git` template,
so annotated-tag discipline plus the CI guard propagate to every consumer.

**PRs merged:** #813

**Issues closed:** #812. Journal PR carries no milestone.

## 2026-08-02 — v2.36 Branch & session hygiene and v2.37 Documentation & README conventions

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

Two milestones planned and drained in one session, plus a tracker decision.

**Groom.** The 39 untriaged downstream issues were clustered into ten groups
by target file, the eight carrying no priority label were labelled, and the
overlaps recorded: #846 and #849 were largely overtaken by #880, which shipped
the day before; #816 and #824 are one convention in two files; #863 blocks on
#859.

**v2.36 — Branch & session hygiene** (#888-#899). The startup branch cleanup
(#865) was broken in this repo's own CLAUDE.md: `git branch --merged main`
cannot match a squash-merged branch, so it exits 0 having deleted nothing.
Four merged branches had accumulated unnoticed. The requirement moved to
`scope.md` with the `gh` commands in `platform/github.md`. Also: tests must not
signal host processes (#858), the two branch-deletion paths under a stack
(#859, #863), `fetch.prune` (#836), an imperative end-of-session audit (#825),
verifying a visual change against the render (#820), and the submodule-versus-
linter warning (#861).

**v2.37 — Documentation & README conventions** (#901-#906). Badges move under
the H1 and the capability list becomes required section 2 under `## Features`,
which also answered #835 (#881). No ADR citations in the README (#882). Check
the inherited rule before calling a document wrong (#864). Cite by persistent
identifier (#845). Delegate to a self-documenting source (#822). The
`examples/` convention across `readme.md` and `python-lib.md` (#816, #824).

**Tracker.** GitHub is the system of record; Linear is a view. #887 removed
the Linear ticket from this repo's branch-naming convention. The template side
(#883) is still open.

**Decision:** partial ADR supersession dropped (#856, `wontdo`). Representing
it would have needed a superseding ADR against ADR-010, a change to the
`status=Superseded iff superseded_by non-empty` invariant in `run_smoke.py`,
and new wording — three coupled changes to give one field a second conditional
meaning.

**Lesson — test the claim, do not reason about it.** #859 shipped a blanket
"never delete a branch under a stack". Two throwaway stacks against scratch
bases disproved half of it within minutes: deletion *as part of the merge*
retargets the dependent PR and leaves it open, while a separate delete-branch
flag closes it irreversibly. The blanket rule also contradicted `git.md`'s own
"enable automatic head-branch deletion" two sections earlier. #863's PR
narrowed it.

**Lesson — verify the tool before believing its finding.** Two defects reported
at the end of v2.36 were both false. `awk 'length>80'` counts *bytes*, and an
em dash is three of them, so every line with one read as over-long; a
character-based scan of every template returns zero violations. The MD029
warnings flag deliberate continuous numbering that CommonMark renders
correctly. Neither was filed; #900 (silence MD029) was filed instead.

**Lesson — a self-referential count goes stale silently.** Renumbering the
README sections broke two claims elsewhere: `review.md` asserted "all 8
required sections", and `readme.md`'s own Audience rule said "the first three
sections". The first was caught by grepping for it, the second only by
re-reading the whole section afterwards — which is #847's rule, applied to the
PR that was implementing its neighbours.

**Template feedback:** all sixteen are template changes distilled from
downstream evidence — reusable upstream content, which is what this repo is.

**PRs merged:** #887-#906

**Issues closed:** #816, #820, #822, #824, #825, #835, #836, #845, #856,
#858, #859, #861, #863, #864, #865, #881, #882. Opened #900; reopened #883.

## 2026-08-02 — Milestone lanes retired, then v2.38 and v2.39

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

A tracker cleanup that turned into a template rule, a full groom of the
remaining backlog, then two milestones planned and drained.

**Milestone lanes retired (ADR-023, #914, PR #915).** Deleting the `Backlog`
and `Expedite` milestones exposed that `platform/github.md` prescribed both as
rules and `issues.md` named a `Backlog`-milestoned issue as the home for
deferred work. Each lane was a milestone doing a label's job: `Backlog`
answered "is this parked" and `Expedite` "is this urgent", both properties of
the issue rather than of a release, and both already encoded by `P4` and the
severity band. A milestone's meaning is also not durable — closing or deleting
one strips the field from every attached issue, while a label survives. The
deferred-work rule was additionally stale against ADR-021, still calling its
`Backlog` issue "distinct from a P4 'someday' issue" after `P4` had been
redefined as exactly a deferral marker.

**Groom.** The 33 untriaged issues sorted into five themed minors (v2.38-v2.42)
rather than one cut, matching the v2.29-v2.35 precedent and the eight-issue
release size. Three moved into v3.0 because they depend on files v3.0 creates,
each verified from the issue's own text rather than by theme resemblance: #815
names the CLI conventions #755 introduces, #857 defers to `frontend/seo.md`
from #624, #844 needs the placement #492 decides. #831 and #832 stayed
unmilestoned on `P4` — putting a deliberately-deferred issue into a dated cut
would contradict the rule shipped an hour earlier.

**v2.38 — Review discipline** (#918-#922). Four of the seven issues were
retractions of confident, wrong findings, and they shared one shape: the
finding was reported before it was demonstrated, and the check that would have
caught it depended on the finding's provenance. `review.md`'s agent-findings
section widened into "Verifying a finding before reporting it", organised by
whether the finding came from a read (#860), a measurement (#912), an
extraction (#846), or an agent (#849). Also: re-read the whole section after
changing a sentence (#847), composite-metric independence (#833), and auditing
every step of a composite gate command rather than the one that broke (#843).

**v2.39 — Pipeline & derived-data correctness** (#924-#926). A new
`Expensive computations (if applicable)` section in `quality.md` pairs the two
halves of one construct: do not hand back an unconverged result, and do not
discard the state you already paid for (#818, #828). Two rules govern what such
a pipeline may emit — blank a derived quantity outside its defining condition
(#827), and take the fidelity bar from the strictest *visible* consumer (#829).
A diagnostic view must run through the production entry point (#830).

**Lesson — measure reach, do not recall it.** Session memory recorded
`base-review` as reference-only with zero chains. `resolve.py` shows it
resolves in 17 of 17. That inverted a placement: #849's suggested home
(`agents.md`) reaches nothing, so it went to `review.md` instead. The same
check moved #828 out of `base/data/` (4 of 17, all web services) into
`quality.md`. Reach is the placement criterion and it is one command away.

**Lesson — a rule found its own class of bug one release later.** Applying the
self-referential-claim check from #847 to the Calibration discipline section
while editing it showed the intro claiming "three failure modes ... the rules
below address each" against six existing subsections. The claim was accurate
when written and drifted as rules accumulated. Rewritten to carry no count.

**Template feedback:** all thirteen are template changes distilled from
downstream evidence — reusable upstream content, which is what this repo is.
The milestone-lane removal is the exception in kind: it began as a local
tracker cleanup and became a rule only because the templates prescribed the
thing being removed.

**Releases:** v2.38.0, v2.39.0. Milestones v2.36-v2.39 closed; v2.36 and v2.37
had shipped earlier the same day but were left open.

**PRs merged:** #915, #918, #920, #921, #922, #924, #925, #926

**Issues closed:** #914, #818, #827, #828, #829, #830, #833, #843, #846,
#847, #849, #860, #912. Milestones `Backlog` and `Expedite` deleted;
v2.40-v2.42 created. Journal PR carries no milestone.

## 2026-08-02 — v2.40 Tooling, containers & CI

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

A tracker placement pass, then the milestone drained end to end.

**Placement.** Five issues left unmilestoned by the previous session were
placed: the two `platform/github.md` bugs (#916, #917) into v2.40 alongside
the lychee item already there, the submodule read-discipline rule (#927) into
v2.42 with the tracker work, and the two `git.md` merge-mechanics rules (#919,
#923) into a new v2.43 — no existing theme fit them, and folding them into
v2.42 would have made its title stop describing its contents. #831 and #832
stay unmilestoned, which is now correct rather than an oversight: ADR-023
deleted the milestone lanes, so `P4` alone carries deferral.

**Deferral conformance.** ADR-023 requires `P4` plus explicitly named trigger
conditions, and neither #831 nor #832 had one. Both were migrated out of the
`Backlog` milestone on 2026-08-02 by label alone, so the parking rationale the
milestone carried implicitly was lost with it. Triggers were written from each
issue's own content, with the provenance stated on the issue.

**v2.40 — Tooling, containers & CI** (#931-#937). The `## GitHub Pages`
heading had been deleted rather than displaced when Branch cleanup was
inserted, stranding two HTTPS rules under the wrong ID; restored, and the
garbled mismatch bullet directly above it repaired in the same PR since the
edits touch adjacent lines (#916, #917). MD029 joins the disabled house-style
rules (#900). The Lychee note splits into internal and external halves (#848).
The editor's type-checker defers to the CI type gate (#826). An editable
install bind-mounted over its own workdir is guarded against layout drift
(#817), and the write-persistence boundary is documented (#821).

**Lesson — an issue's suggested home is a hypothesis, not a decision.** #834
named `base/workflow/scope.md`, which resolves into 1 of 17 chains.
`base/core/git.md` is 17 of 17 and already owned a
`### Verifying regenerated artifacts` section on exactly that topic — where
one of the issue's three proposed rules already existed, so it was dropped
rather than duplicated. This is the same lesson as v2.39's "measure reach, do
not recall it", one step earlier: measure before accepting the issue's own
suggestion, not only before recalling from memory.

**Lesson — a rule can contradict, not just omit.** #826's `git.md` half read
as a small addition. The `.gitignore` section already said to ignore
`.vscode/` wholesale, which is incompatible with tracking the editor config
the new Layer 1 rule requires. Landing the addition without the allowlist
would have shipped two rules that cannot both be followed.

**Lesson — retiring a lane does not retire its prose.** #831's proposed
template text still instructed "file a Backlog issue" weeks after ADR-023
deleted the lane. Implementing it verbatim would have reintroduced the
retired lane into the very file the ADR stripped it from. After an ADR
removes a concept, grep open issue bodies for it, not only `templates/`.

**Template feedback:** all eight are template changes distilled from
downstream evidence — reusable upstream content. #900 is the exception: it
configures this repo's own editor tooling and travels nowhere.

**Releases:** v2.40.0. Milestone v2.40 closed; v2.43 created.

**PRs merged:** #931, #932, #933, #934, #935, #936, #937

**Issues closed:** #916, #917, #900, #848, #834, #826, #817, #821. Journal PR

## 2026-08-02 — v2.41 Python & API conventions

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Label gap closed first.** #938 and #939 were filed during the previous
session carrying no labels at all, which CLAUDE.md 2.2 forbids at creation.
They surfaced only because a status sweep enumerated unmilestoned issues —
nothing in CI or the tracker objects to an unlabeled ticket, so the rule is
currently a constraint without its check. Both were labeled `task` / `P3`
and placed in v2.41, taking the milestone from six issues to eight.

**v2.41 — Python & API conventions** (#942-#949). Five rules land in
`python-lib.md`: a test suite's own `sys.path` insert defeats the `src/`
layout (#938), the documented commands must be re-run after a path move
(#939), a stale in-tree `*.egg-info` shadows the fresh `dist-info` (#840),
a library's dependency floors move only when required (#862), and the test
suite is exempt from the ruff `D` rules (#838). Three land in the core
tier: a pluggable tier is named for what it requires of the caller (#908),
the module-to-package split preserves its import path (#837), and a
registered config object also loads from a user file through one resolver
(#819).

**Lesson — a green gate certifies what survived, not what the move was
for.** #938 and #939 are the same defect from two sides. #719 had already
landed the config-side audit for a `src/` move: anchor every path-based
exclude, compare scanned-file counts. In the reported case that audit
passes and its answer is correct — nothing collided. Meanwhile the suite
was still importing from the tree through a `conftest.py` insert that had
simply been repointed, and the README's headline example had stopped
working. Tests, coverage, statement counts, formatted-file counts, mypy
source counts and wheel contents were identical before and after. The
verification has to target the guarantee the move was adopted for
(collection MUST fail against an uninstalled package), not the artifacts
the tooling happens to scan.

**Lesson — the inherited-rule check earns its keep.** #838 is not an
omission but a contradiction across the inheritance boundary:
`python-lib.md` selected the ruff `D` rules without exempting tests, while
`quality-gates-exclusions` in its own dependency chain already rules
docstring coverage on non-public functions out as busywork. Every project
generated from the stack failed `ruff check` on its own test suite at
scaffold time. v2.37's #864 added the check for exactly this; this is the
first case it would have caught.

**Template feedback:** all eight are reusable upstream content distilled
from downstream evidence (`page-fetcher`, `corrosim`). No project-specific
changes in this milestone.

**Releases:** v2.41.0. Milestone v2.41 closed.

**PRs merged:** #942, #943, #944, #945, #946, #947, #948, #949

**Issues closed:** #938, #939, #840, #862, #838, #908, #837, #819. Journal
PR carries no milestone.

## 2026-08-02 — v2.42 Documentation, licence & tracker

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**v2.42 — Documentation, licence & tracker** (#953-#958). Three rules land
in `issues.md`: the code host is the system of record and the tracker is a
replaceable view over it (#883), the label-at-creation rule is paired with
a conformance check (#952), and a duplicate chain MUST NOT terminate in a
closed issue (#913). `platform-github-labels` carries the concrete `gh`
query; `platform-linear-codehost` is reworded so code-host authority is the
premise rather than a condition on enabling sync. The other three: a README
MUST NOT state a measured value that moves without an edit (#907), a
consuming repository reads the issue list at upstream HEAD and its rules at
the pinned revision (#927), and a redistributed dependency carries an
attribution obligation that approving its licence does not discharge
(#839).

**The milestone closed a loop it opened.** #883 is the P1 rule that went
missing when #883 and #886 were closed against each other; #913 is the rule
forbidding exactly that closure pattern. Both shipped here — the dropped
ticket and the rule that stops the drop, in the same cut. #952 has the same
shape one step removed: it was filed this session against this repository's
own unlabeled #938 and #939, and shipped in the milestone immediately
after the one where the failure occurred.

**Lesson — poll for a terminal state, not for the absence of a running
one.** Two merges this session failed with `QUEUED` after a wait loop
reported the checks finished. The loop asked whether any check was
`PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`. Immediately after a push the answer is no
because the array is *empty* — CI has not registered yet — and later the
answer is no again because the state is `QUEUED`, which is neither. Both
times the loop fell through and `gh pr merge` refused. The correct
predicate is positive: at least one check present, and every state in
{`SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `SKIPPED`, `NEUTRAL`}. Enumerating the states that
mean "not done" fails open on any state not enumerated; enumerating the
states that mean "done" fails closed.

**Template feedback:** all six are reusable upstream content. #883, #952,
#913 and #927 came from applying this chain to `braboj/page-fetcher` and to
this repository itself; #907 and #839 from `page-fetcher` and `corrosim`.

**Releases:** v2.42.0. Milestone v2.42 closed.

**PRs merged:** #953, #954, #955, #956, #957, #958

**Issues closed:** #883, #952, #913, #907, #927, #839. Journal PR carries
no milestone.

## 2026-08-02 — P4 retired: priority is severity only

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**The `P4` deferral marker is gone** (#960, ADR-024). Priority is now a
pure four-band severity scale, `P0`–`P3`, one per issue. Deferral moves to
the milestone field: milestoned means planned into that cut, unmilestoned
means backlog. The label was deleted repository-wide, which strips it from
closed issues as well as open ones.

**The reasoning that flipped.** ADR-021 had considered dropping the marker
and rejected it — removing it "pushes the information into prose, where it
stops being filterable". That held only if the alternative to a label was
prose. It is not. The milestone field is itself a first-class, filterable
axis, already mandatory reading when scoping a release and already
documented as optional, with an empty value meaning the work is not tied to
a release. Deferral was being recorded twice in two places that can
disagree. Of the four open issues carrying the marker, two also carried a
milestone and two carried none; in neither pair did the label say anything
the milestone field did not already say.

**What the milestone field cannot say, the body now must.** The objection
ADR-021 raised against folding deferral into a tracker's unset value —
deliberate decisions become unfindable among untriaged ones — applies to an
empty milestone too, and is answered rather than dismissed. Triage here is
the type and severity applied at creation, not the milestone, so an empty
milestone means unscheduled and never untriaged; `base-issues-defer` now
states that explicitly. The trigger conditions in the issue body remain the
record that a deferral was deliberate. What is genuinely lost is the label
filter that used to surface the backlog on its own, so the section gained a
bullet requiring the unmilestoned set to be re-read when a cut is scoped.

**Lesson — retiring a concept does not retire its prose, and this is the
second time it fired.** ADR-023 deleted the `Backlog` lane, and weeks
later #831's proposed template text still said "file a Backlog issue".
That was recorded as a lesson. It happened again in the same file: the same
issue's step 4 instructed a future implementer to apply "a severity label
plus `P4`", so implementing #831 verbatim would have written the marker
back into `platform/github.md` — the exact file this change strips it from.
An open issue body is a delayed write against the templates, and a
concept-removal PR that greps only `templates/` leaves those writes armed.
Both #831 and #832 were rewritten to describe the `Backlog` → `P4` →
unmilestoned migration as history rather than as instruction. The lesson
then landed as a rule (#962): retiring a concept sweeps every surface that
instructs its use, and is done only when a search returns historical
records and no surviving instruction.

**Reach decided the home, and the obvious home was the wrong one.** The
new rule reads as issue-tracker content, which puts it next to
`base-issues-defer` in `issues.md`. Measuring first: `issues.md` resolves
into 1 of 17 stacks, `quality.md` into 17 of 17. The rule went to
`quality.md` beside the existing before-removing-a-public-symbol rule,
where it also mirrors the citation-inherits-its-lifecycle rule pointing
the other way. Worth noting for the P4 change itself — its `issues.md`
edits ship to `stack-tutorial` alone, and only the `platform/` edits
travel widely, since a platform template is chosen independently of the
stack chain.

**Template feedback:** reusable upstream content, already landed.
`base-issues-types` drops the fifth band, `base-issues-defer` is restated
against the milestone field, `platform-github-labels` drops its deferral
table and the conformance-check caveat that existed only to exclude `P4`
from the priority pattern, and `platform-linear-priority` carries the same
rule against a cycle or project milestone. `CLAUDE.md` §2.2 and the
`devsecops` triage flow follow.

**Releases:** none. v2.43 stays open — #923 and #919 remain.

**PRs merged:** #961

**Issues closed:** #960. Journal PR carries no milestone.

## 2026-08-03 — v2.43 Git merge mechanics

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Two independent PRs merged back to back hit the same refusal a stack
does** (#923). Under "Require branches to be up to date before merging",
merging the first moves the base and makes every other open PR stale, so
the next merge is refused for a reason that has nothing to do with
content — it fires on disjoint files and on branches that were never
stacked. `De-stacking a dependent branch` framed the merge-`main`-in step
as a consequence of duplicate commits and `Merging a stack` framed it as
a consequence of stacking, so a reader who had internalised both still
did not expect it. `git.md` now carries `Merging a batch of PRs` between
`Squash-merge safety` and the de-stacking section, and prices the case:
N ready PRs are N merges and N-1 update-plus-CI cycles.

**The de-stacking rule was mandating the more expensive of two equal
routes** (#919). Cherry-picking B fresh off updated main was the only
sanctioned option, and it closes B's PR — discarding its comments and
approvals. Retargeting B and merging main in is equally force-push free,
and under squash merge lands byte-identical content on `main`; the merge
commit it carries is deleted by the squash that follows. Both routes are
now permitted, with the trade-off named so the choice is informed:
cherry-pick when the diff will be read carefully and there is no review
history worth keeping, merge in when B is already reviewed or the stack
is deep enough that re-cherry-picking each level is error-prone. The
equivalence rests on squash merge, so that condition is stated — where
the merge commit would survive on `main`, cherry-pick. The `MUST NOT
rebase an already-pushed branch` from #336 is untouched.

**A null that means two things defeated the precedence table** (#963).
`config.md` already forbade a lower-priority source overriding a higher
one; what was missing was the mechanism. A parser helper returning the
value after a flag, or null when there is none, collapses "flag absent"
with "flag present as the last argument". `tool <target> --wait` then
runs with the hardcoded default: highest-priority source beaten by the
lowest, no error, exit zero — and the shape of it guarantees the failure
lands exactly when the user was trying to set the value. The rule extends
to empty environment variables and empty config keys, which fail
identically. Pulled into this cut rather than left in the backlog,
because it is a silent-failure trap and `config.md` reaches 15 of 17
stacks.

**Reach blocked a placement again, before the edit rather than after**
(#951). The proposed rule — re-read the project's own divergence records
before deciding what a bumped submodule range means, since a rule the
project deliberately does not follow can move upstream and read as a gap
to close — targets `scope.md` item 10, which is where the reconciliation
gap genuinely sits. `scope.md` resolves into 1 of 17 stacks, and that one
is the Astro tutorial site: the least likely place for a submodule
reconciliation. Same trap `issues.md` has. Measuring first cost minutes
and moved the rule: it landed in `docs.md` under `Decision logs` (17/17),
generalised past submodules to any source a divergence was recorded
against, and beside the existing rule for an ADR premise refuted shortly
after merge — the same shape with the refutation arriving from outside.
Nothing was added to `scope.md`, since a pointer there would restate the
rule and the repository has no inline cross-references by design.

The part worth keeping is the second bullet: a reconciliation MUST
separate what the range refuted from what it merely moved nearby. In the
source case the decision survived untouched while the fallback it named
was deleted upstream — that is a repair to the record, not grounds to
reverse it, and reading the diff alone cannot tell the two apart.

**None of this session's own merges hit #923.** Each branch was cut from
main after the previous PR merged, so nothing was ever stale. That is the
other way to avoid the N-1 update cycles, and it costs nothing when the
work is serial anyway — the rule earns its keep when several PRs are
already open and waiting.

**Template feedback:** all four items are reusable upstream content and
all four landed. `base-git` gains `Merging a batch of PRs` and a widened
`De-stacking a dependent branch`; `base-config` gains the absent-versus-
empty distinction under `Config precedence`; `base-docs` gains the
divergence-reconciliation pair under `Decision logs`. Every one of those
files is core-tier — `git.md` and `docs.md` reach all 17 stacks,
`config.md` 15 — so all five rules travel.

**Releases:** v2.43.0 — Git merge mechanics. #951 merged after the tag,
so it is unreleased on main and belongs to the next cut.

**PRs merged:** #966, #967, #968, #972

**Issues closed:** #923, #919, #963, #951.

## 2026-08-03 — v2.44 Consumer reconciliation

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Both halves of a bump were unspecified in the same direction** (#970,
#971). `base-agents` already settled which revision a consumer *reads* —
the issue list at HEAD, the rules at the pin — and that read-side rule
had made the write side look settled too. It was not. A downstream bump
procedure ran `checkout origin/main`, the exact read the section forbids,
applied to the pin. It had never produced a wrong pin, because until
`v2.42.0` the newest tag *was* `origin/main` every time it ran. Upstream
kept working past a release and the two separated: a ticket describing
the `v2.41.0 → v2.42.0` range attributed a rule to it that lives four
commits past the tag. The rule now says pin a released tag, and prices
the second cost — a tag range is citable, "whatever `main` was that
afternoon" is not, which leaves the commit message as the only record of
what moved.

**A convenience list was silently acting as the definition** (#971). A
consumer's `CLAUDE.md` names its resolved chain, and reconciling the
`v2.42.0` bump against that list was wrong twice at once. It missed
`workflow/issues.md`, which is not in the list but is reached through
`platform/github.md` — so `base-issues-record` governed that repository
while it maintained the same convention by hand, unaware upstream owned
it. And it nearly imported `agents.md` and `security/devsecops.md`, both
changed in the same range and both plausible, neither reachable from
anything declared. The asymmetry is what earns the rule: a missed file
looks like a local doc drifting, an over-included one looks like ordinary
diligence, and both pass for reconciliation work rather than a scoping
error. Governance resolves through the `DEPENDS ON` headers; any list a
consumer writes down is a cache of that resolution.

**The placement rule pointed away from the right home, and it was still
right to run it** (#980). Both issues suggested `agents.md`. Measuring
per PLAYBOOK step 2 returned 0 of 17 stacks — read literally, grounds to
reject. `agents.md` was correct anyway: `INTERVIEW.md` reads it directly,
so it shapes every generated file by a route `resolve.py` does not
measure. The step's justification — "a rule in a template no chain
resolves reaches no generated context file" — is false for the templates
the pipeline itself reads. Chain reach answers *does this travel to
generated projects*; it cannot answer *does this travel at all*. Filed
rather than fixed in-session: the 0/17 set is currently labelled
"reference-only", which conflates a different route with low value, and
separating those is more than a wording fix.

**Prose that quotes a directive is parsed as a declaration** (#979). The
transitive-governance rule first spelled `DEPENDS ON` out in its bracket
form inside backticks, and SYS-01 plus SYS-04 failed against a phantom
file. Backticks are not respected — the parser scans the whole file, and
a declaration is only meaningful in the header. Shipped by naming the
header in prose instead, which is a workaround no author will remember,
so the parser is filed as the actual defect. Worth noting the failure
misdirects: the message names a file that was never referenced.

**Template feedback:** both rules are reusable upstream content and both
landed in `base-agents` "Vendoring the templates", extending the existing
two-revisions rule rather than opening a parallel section. Chain reach is
0/17 and irrelevant here — `INTERVIEW.md` reads the file directly, so
they travel to every generated context file. Nothing this session was
project-specific.

**Releases:** v2.44.0 — Consumer reconciliation. Annotated tag first per
the recipe #974 landed the day before; `tag-guard` green, and
`--verify-tag` had nothing left to create.

**PRs merged:** #975, #978

**Issues closed:** #970, #971

**Issues opened:** #979, #980 — both unmilestoned, triggered by the next
cut being scoped.

## 2026-08-05 — v2.45 Examples governance

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Reconstructed entry.** The session shipped without one, and the gap
surfaced twenty days later while scoping the next cut. What follows is
drawn from ADR-025 and the two merged pull requests, not from the
session; the reasoning below is the ADR's, restated.

**Two gaps sat in a seam, and neither owner was the place to fix them**
(#987, #988). Governance of an `examples/` directory was split in half.
`stack/python-lib.md` prescribed the directory, `base/core/readme.md`
prescribed its contents, and the bridge between them was a single
conditional bullet under the README's Project structure section — a rule
about how example code *runs*, reached through the template that governs
README prose, because the index happens to be a README. "Smoke-tested in
CI" never said how the package is installed for that job, and the
cheapest reading, reuse the test job, proves the examples run beside the
test tooling rather than against the published surface. Separately, the
index is the one document whose body is machine-generated program
output, which the secret scanner reads like source: a printed cache key
matched `generic-api-key` and failed the scan on a file containing no
secret.

**A file-level ID makes a rule unaddressable** (ADR-025).
`base/core/readme.md` carries one `[ID: base-readme]` and no section
IDs, so a project needing to extend the offline rule had to replace the
entire README contract to reach it. That, with `base-readme` sitting in
the core tier while `python-lib` was the only stack of seventeen
prescribing the directory, decided the shape: a dedicated
`base/core/examples.md` reached by `depends_on` rather than by the core
tier. The core tier is the set that applies to every project, and most
projects ship no examples directory — a conditional concern does not
belong there.

**Offline needed a boundary, not a ban.** An absolute rule reads as
"build a fake of your vendor's API before you may ship an example",
which charges a documentation rule for an architectural seam. Where no
seam exists the alternative to a dated example is no example. The rule
landed as reproducibility rather than socket abstinence, with a named
exception the deviating project declares per example.

**Template feedback:** all reusable upstream content.
`templates/base/core/examples.md` is new (`[ID: base-examples]`), with
per-section IDs so one rule can be extended without replacing a
neighbouring contract. `base/core/readme.md` §5 reduces to a pointer.
`python-lib`, `go-lib` and `nodejs-lib` keep only what is
language-specific — packaging exclusion, install command, file
extension, position relative to the source layout.

**ADRs:** ADR-025 — Examples get their own template.

**Releases:** none at the time; cut later as v2.45.0.

**PRs merged:** #990, #992

**Issues closed:** #988, #991

**Issues opened:** none. #987 stays open — its second request, repeating
the commit-history point wherever the secret scan is described, is
platform-template scope.

## 2026-08-25 — Backlog groom and the v2.45 cut

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Forty-three issues carried neither a type nor a priority label.** The
August intake ran to 68 new issues in three weeks and none of them was
labelled at creation, which CLAUDE.md §2.2 requires. The conformance
check in `platform-github-labels` exists precisely to catch this and
returns a list nothing reads, so a rule with a check still decayed for
three weeks. It now returns `[]` again. The distribution that came out:
3 P1 bugs, 5 P2 bugs, 59 P2 tasks, 31 P3 tasks, 15 spikes, 1 epic.

**Six of the forty-three were defects, not gaps.** In a template repo the
`bug` type is easy to under-use, because everything reads as "a rule
could be extended". The line that held: a rule that states something
false, contradicts another rule, or is one the repository itself
breaks is a defect in existing functionality. `platform/github.md:138`
claims CodeQL is "free for all repositories (public and private)" and
private repositories need paid Code Security (#1030). Two
`platform-github` rules make an isolated elevated-scope scan unable to
join the fan-in it is required to join (#1042). The mandatory startup
block resolves one manifest axis, so every consumer's chain silently
omits the platform layer (#1029).

**A rule the templates break 17,571 times** (#1045). `base-quality`
restricts content to ASCII and names no check. Measured over tracked
Markdown: 172 of 188 files carry non-ASCII, 14,788 em dashes among them.
`base-docs` forbids Unicode box-drawing *citing that rule as its reason*
and then uses it 753 times. Filed at `v2.44.0` against 170 of 186 files
and 17,350 characters; re-measured during the groom at 172 of 188 and
17,571. An unchecked rule does not hold steady, it loses ground, and the
drift is invisible in a diff.

**The tracker is duplicating itself because nothing greps it before
filing.** Six clusters of overlapping issues came out of the sweep, each
one several issues editing the same section from different angles. The
sharpest: "a trigger has no watcher" was filed three times in three days
across two templates (#1036, #1041, #1052). None is a strict duplicate —
each carries a distinct claim — so none was closed. They are recorded as
one pull request each instead, which is the cheaper correction.

**Verify before grooming, not after.** Four issue claims were re-checked
against `main` before labelling, on the standing lesson that a
weeks-deep backlog has items overtaken by later work. All four were
still live, and one had got worse. The check cost four greps and would
have cost a milestone if any had already landed.

**Template feedback:** nothing project-specific. The self-duplicating
tracker is a candidate upstream rule — `base-issues` says how to write
and defer an issue and nothing about searching the tracker before
opening one — but it is not filed yet, and filing it without searching
first would be the joke writing itself.

**Releases:** v2.45.0 — Examples governance, covering #988 and #991.
Milestone created retroactively so the tag had a complete cut behind it;
annotated tag first per the recipe, `tag-guard` green, `--verify-tag`
had nothing left to create.

**A generated file can rot without either invocation being wrong**
(#984). The arc42 pull request had sat 22 days and was three commits
behind; `gh pr update-branch` brought it current and both sides had
regenerated `generated/` from different bases. Git merged the two sets
of regenerated output textually, and a textual merge of generated files
is not the output of any invocation of the generator. It happened to be
correct here — `sync.py --check` passed, and `base-examples` and the new
arc42 rules both survive in all 17 chains — but that was checked, not
assumed. `docs-generated` names three rot modes and #1002 proposes the
wrong invocation as a fourth; this is arguably a fifth, and it is the
one a merge produces silently. Filed nowhere yet, because it wants a
measurement first rather than a rule written from one instance.

**PRs merged:** #1059, #984.

**Issues closed:** #983 — auto-closed by #984, verified.

**Issues opened:** none.

## 2026-08-26 — v2.46 Unenforced rules

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**A rule can be wrong rather than under-enforced** (#1045, #1067). The
ASCII restriction read as covering all source content, and measuring it
returned 5,593 characters across 155 of 171 files. It also returned
zero of the hazards an ASCII rule exists to prevent: no smart quotes, no
non-breaking spaces, no zero-width characters, no byte-order marks. What
it had missed was five U+FFFD, the residue of text decoded with the
wrong encoding, one of which shipped through two chains and left a rule
justification unreadable downstream. So the rule banned 5,593 harmless
characters and caught none of the five that were real damage. Twice the
answer was to narrow the rule rather than sweep the files, and the
second pass mattered more than the first: the rule still covered string
literals, and `tools/sync.py` draws the specification trees with
box-drawing literals, so enforcing it would have rewritten 98 lines of
documentation into ASCII on the authority of a code rule.

**A number written into a template is a preference shipped downstream**
(#1055, #1072). Width resolved into the same shape as charset. The rule
states that a width is declared once and checked; the project supplies
the number. Moving this repository from 80 to 88 then re-scoped the
check with no code change at all, which was the test of whether the
design was right rather than merely tidy. Two templates still named 80
and now name nothing.

**Every check had to be run, not written** (#1056, #1045, #1069). Three
shipped broken on the first attempt. A regex using the anchor and
newline escapes did not survive the trip into the template and raised
`SyntaxError` on extraction. The ASCII check crashed with
`UnicodeEncodeError` while reporting a non-ASCII character, which is the
failure it existed to detect. The width check carried backslashes and
was refused. The habit that came out: an embedded check is
backslash-free, prints code points rather than characters, and is
extracted from the committed template and executed before the pull
request opens.

**A check that reports nothing and a check that reaches nothing look
identical** (#999, #1015, #1069). Every check landed with its inputs
counted -- 65 journal entries, 25 decision records, 8 source files, 17
chains -- and with a table of the break modes it catches. Two of them
treat an empty result as a failure for the same reason: no entries found
means the heading format drifted, and no wheel in `dist/` means the
build never ran.

**The mangled output was a boundary, not a character.** Smoke printed
`23 checks ? 23 passed` for the whole session. Not the em dash: an unset
output encoding, inherited from the console. Five entry points now set
it explicitly, which fixes every string that crosses the boundary
including ones not written yet.

**Withdrawn:** a decision record proposing an enumerated
permitted-character set for Markdown. It was Latin-centric by
construction and would have broken a document written in another
language. Number 026 was never merged and returned to the pool; the
number now in use for it belongs to a different decision.

**Filed rather than fixed:** #1062, the only reference-mode example
names no platform template, which needs a pipeline regeneration rather
than a hand edit. #1080, one decision record overflows the declared
width on an unbreakable code span, deferred behind #1054 because
settling it would decide that issue sideways in a commit about
whitespace.

**Template feedback:** all reusable. Checks now travel beside their
rules in `base-quality`, `base-docs` and `python-lib-structure`. The
width rule states no number, the charset rule guards identifiers only,
and the ADR schema finally matches what the project practises.

**Releases:** v2.46.0 -- Unenforced rules, 11 issues, all three open P1
bugs cleared.

**PRs merged:** #1061, #1063, #1065, #1068, #1070, #1071, #1073, #1074,
#1075, #1078, #1079

**Issues closed:** #983, #999, #1015, #1029, #1045, #1055, #1056, #1064,
#1067, #1069, #1072

**Issues opened:** #1062, #1064, #1067, #1069, #1072, #1080

## 2026-08-26 — Immutability ruling and backlog rescope (afternoon)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**An enumeration of permitted operations is under-inclusive by
construction** (#1054, #1080). The ADR exemption listed what a
format-only edit may do -- normalize headings, titles, filenames,
cross-links -- so anything unlisted implicitly needed a superseding
record. It now states its test instead: immutability protects the
decision, meaning the claims made in Context, Decision, Alternatives
considered and Consequences, and any edit that moves no claim is a
format change. Rewrapping, splitting an unparseable sentence and
rendering a buried enumeration as a list all qualify, with
`git diff --word-diff` as the evidence. The first record it applied to
was one this repository had been unable to fix for exactly that reason:
a line two characters over the declared width, on an inline code span
with no wrap point. The word-level diff showed no word changed.

**A milestone that collects everything nobody wants to decide about
stops being a milestone.** v3.0 held 38 issues and had not started. The
cut line turned out to be simple once stated: the restructure changes
how a consumer's context file *loads* rules, and does not change what
the rules say. Rule content survives any delivery change, so it ships
now. Twenty-eight issues went back to the backlog -- new templates, a
language layer, frontend layer extraction, README polish, and four
orphaned-template questions from an old coverage analysis -- and v3.0
came out at twelve, six of them spikes. The epic reads as "answer six
questions, then implement", which is a tractable shape. Thirty-eight
was not, and that is the likeliest reason it sat untouched since July.

**Applying a criterion is not the same as holding it consistently.**
Having ruled that reach questions are composition rather than delivery,
I still had `base-oop` reach filed on the delivery side while calling
the identical question shippable elsewhere. Caught on re-reading the
split rather than by any check. A criterion stated once needs a pass
back over everything already sorted under it.

**Template feedback:** the immutability change is reusable and landed in
`base-docs` Decision logs. The rescope is project-specific -- it is
tracker hygiene, not a rule.

**Releases:** none. PR #1083 sits unreleased on main and unmilestoned,
which is the third cut in a row where merged work needed a milestone
found for it before a tag.

**PRs merged:** #1083

**Issues closed:** #1054, #1080

**Issues opened:** #1082 -- split from #1054 rather than carried along,
since a readability bound is a separate rule and only became actionable
once fixing an unreadable passage stopped requiring a supersession.

## 2026-08-26 — Check integrity (evening)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**A rule that requires a check is not the same as a rule that requires
the check to work** (#1086). The pairing rule has always demanded that a
mechanically checkable constraint name its command and pass condition.
It said nothing about whether that command runs, reaches its inputs, or
flags the right things -- and five checks written against it in v2.46
shipped three broken on the first attempt. The four observed failure
modes are now rules, and the first of them is itself checked: every
check embedded in a rule file must compile when extracted the way a
reader extracts it.

**The gate rejected its own author, twice over.** The release-milestone
check in #1094 was first written indented five spaces under a numbered
step. A renderer strips a fenced block's own indentation from every line
that has it, so a four-space nested line became three-space and the
extracted body raised `IndentationError`. The compile gate from #1088
named the file and line before the branch was pushed. That was a fifth
break mode none of the four in #1086 covered, so it landed as a rule in
the same section: never indent a fenced check more deeply than the first
indentation level of the code inside it. Writing the anchor rule had
already turned up the same shape in its own prose -- a heredoc opener
written inline in a bullet, read as a check by a naive extractor, which
is #979 wearing different clothes.

**Three things reported nothing because they reached nothing, in one
session.** A negative control that silently matched nothing and
therefore tested nothing. A reach measurement that counted 75 "stacks"
by splitting `--list` description text on whitespace, when there are 17.
An assertion expecting 11 renumbered ordinals where there were 13, which
fired before the write and left the file untouched. Every one was caught
by counting inputs rather than by reading output -- which is the rule
this whole cut is built around, arriving unprompted three times while
the cut was being written.

**Grooming before writing changed two of six issues.** #832 reads as a
missing cross-reference; the section already cross-references the right
neighbouring rule, just for a different reason, so it needed two bullets
rather than a rewrite. #1014 argues its case by quoting "every rule
binds new and modified code, not untouched code" as an existing rule --
`grep` finds nothing like it in this chain, because it belongs to the
downstream project the issue was written from. Both were still worth
doing. Neither was quite the work the issue described.

**The wrong side of a relation passes green.** The release gate confirmed
a milestone's issues were all closed, which cannot see work merged with
no milestone at all -- so three consecutive cuts needed a milestone found
for already-merged work before a tag could be cut, each caught by a
person reading the log. The inverse check now enumerates the pull
requests merged since the previous tag and reports any whose closed
issues carry no milestone. Its negative control was a planted violation:
a milestone removed from one closed issue, the check naming it, the
milestone restored. It validated this session's own cut before the tag.

**A ruling can leave its own earlier statement standing beside it**
(#1097, #1098). The immutability change landed in the template without
retiring the sentence it replaced, so the Decision logs section stated
the superseded rule first -- "the prose body never changes" -- and
corrected it two bullets later. An agent applying rules in order reads
the false one first, and treating ADR prose as frozen is the exact
behaviour the ruling exists to stop. Adding a rule is not the same as
landing it; the old statement has to go in the same pass.

**Deciding to leave something alone still has to be recorded.** The same
stale claim sits in a merged decision record that holds four other
decisions still in daily use. It cannot be edited, because the sentence
is a claim and editing it is what immutability forbids -- performed on
the record that states the immutability rule. It cannot be partly
superseded, because status and the supersession link must agree and the
partial form was rejected in #856. Retiring the whole record to fix one
sentence would archive four working rules. What was left looked like
doing nothing, which is why it needed a record of its own: a decision
record is a dated statement of what was decided on that date, not a live
specification. The specification is the template chain. The record is
doing its job; the template contradicting itself was the actual defect.

**A record that deliberately does not supersede has no link at all.**
The ADR format keeps references to other records in the frontmatter and
forbids naming them in prose, so a correcting record with an empty
`supersedes` field cannot point at what it corrects in either place.
That forced a fourth clause into the decision -- a correcting record
must state its rule completely on its own -- which would have been easy
to miss and would have left the rule unfindable from the stale side.

**Template feedback:** all of it is reusable and landed upstream --
`quality-gates-check-runs`, `quality-gates-check-selection` and
`quality-gates-retrofit-ratchet` in `base/workflow/quality-gates.md`,
`testing-negative-assertion-coverage` in `base/core/testing.md`, and the
pre-release step in `base/core/git.md`, plus the correct-by-new-record rule in
`base-docs`. The only project-specific piece is the
`docs/PLAYBOOK.md` step that applies the release check here.

**Releases:** v2.47.0 (ADR immutability -- a milestone created for the
four commits that had been sitting on main unmilestoned), v2.48.0
(Check integrity, 12 issues, 8 PRs) and v2.49.0 (ADR immutability,
continued -- 2 issues, 2 PRs, milestone created before the work rather
than at tag time).

**PRs merged:** #1088, #1089, #1090, #1091, #1092, #1093, #1094,
#1095, #1099, #1100

**Issues closed:** #832, #1005, #1014, #1024, #1026, #1028, #1031,
#1037, #1044, #1046, #1086, #1087, #1097, #1098

**Issues opened:** #1087 -- filed mid-session after the third
consecutive milestone-at-tag-time scramble, and closed in the same cut,
since the fix is one pre-release step and the evidence was already three
releases deep. #1097 and #1098 -- the same stale claim in two places,
filed separately because a template can be edited and a merged record
cannot, so they needed different remedies. Both closed in v2.49.

**ADRs:** ADR-026 -- a stale claim in a merged record is corrected by a
new record, never by an edit or an addendum, and the template chain is
the authority a reader applies.

## 2026-08-26 -- Merge and release verification (late)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Four green results that prove less than they look like.** A merge with
no conflict, a release pipeline that has never run, a release whose record
was written before the last thing landed, and a numbered document two
branches edited without colliding. Each reports success, and in each the
success is about the wrong question. The cut is six issues in
`base/core/git.md`, which is core tier, so all six reach 17/17 stacks.

**The narrative is usually right, and it is never evidence.** De-stacking
told a maintainer how to resolve a conflict and nothing about verifying
the resolution. Under squash merge the merge base stays the pre-stack tip,
so a file both sides rewrote conflicts whole, and "the branch is newer, it
already contains the lower pull request, take its side" is a story that
holds until anything else lands on the base in between -- after which
taking that side discards it silently and the squash makes the loss
permanent. The remedy is a comparison of the conflict stages, and it was
built as a real de-stack in a throwaway repository rather than reasoned
about: with only the lower branch landed the check reports two insertions
and nothing removed; with an unrelated commit also landed it reports a
deletion and names the line that would be dropped. The first control did
not conflict at all, because the two edits sat on different lines -- the
shape had to be reproduced before it could be measured.

**Which assertion holds depends on how the lower pull request merged**, so
the rule names the case rather than the command. Under rebase merge the
branch is a strict superset and the tree-wide form must be empty. Under
squash the content matches but the history does not, so only the per-file
form holds. Shipping one assertion for both would have been wrong half the
time and green either way.

**A check calibrated against nothing reports nothing.** The ordinal check
for #1020 flagged fourteen violations in `CLAUDE.md` on its first run, all
false: separate numbered lists under different headings were piling into a
single run because a numbered heading was counted as an ordinal without
resetting the group beneath it. Measured against six real documents after
the fix -- 189 ordinals across 37 groups, silent -- and only then against
planted duplicates, in both shapes the issue describes. Enforcing the
first draft would have produced fourteen edits to a compliant file.

**The cut generated its own evidence for one of its issues.** #1020
describes two branches renumbering one document and merging cleanly into a
duplicate. This session renumbered `Pre-release checks` twice in two
separate pull requests, thirteen ordinals each time, and was safe only
because the two were sequential. Run concurrently they are exactly the
defect. The issue was filed from a downstream observation and was
re-confirmed here without anyone looking for it.

**A sixth break mode, and it does not raise.** The five recorded ways an
embedded check breaks all fail loudly or fail closed. This one does
neither: a trailing backslash used as a line continuation did not survive
the authoring path into the template, and the command arrived collapsed
onto one line with the backslash replaced by spaces. The shell does not
care, so it still runs, and the compile gate passes because a joined line
is valid. It was found by reading the committed file rather than by any
check, and both affected commands were rewritten so that no line ends with
a backslash. Filed rather than fixed in place, since the rules it belongs
to are a different file and a different cut.

**An empty result that exits zero is not a pass.** `gh run list` against a
workflow with no matching runs prints `0` and exits `0`, so a release
pipeline that has never executed produces the same silence as one that has
run a hundred times. The pass condition names `0` as the finding for that
reason, and separates it from the unknown-workflow error, which is drift
rather than an absence of runs.

**The generated tree is a second output of every core-tier edit.** The
first pull request failed CI on seventeen stale chains, because
`sync.py --check` had been run at the start of the session and not after
the change. Running a gate before the work it gates is the same class of
error as writing a check and not running it.

**Template feedback:** all of it is reusable and landed upstream in
`base/core/git.md` -- the de-stack measurement and its two case-scoped
assertions, the delete-on-merge setting check, the two pre-release steps
for an unproven pipeline, the release-ordering step, and the
ordered-document rule with its check. Nothing here is project-specific.

**Releases:** v2.50.0 -- Merge and release verification, 6 issues, 4 pull
requests, milestone created before the work.

**PRs merged:** #1105, #1106, #1108, #1109

**Issues closed:** #996, #1016, #1020, #1040, #1048, #1053

**Issues opened:** #1110 -- the collapsed line continuation, filed against
the check-integrity rules rather than fixed in this cut, since it is a
sixth break mode in a file this milestone does not touch.

## 2026-08-26 -- Repository migration and platform corrections (night)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Guidance that was true once.** Where the previous cut was about green
results that answer the wrong question, this one is about statements that
were correct when written and are not now. Two of the eight issues are
`bug` rather than `task`, which matters: a missing rule leaves a reader
without help, while a wrong one sends them somewhere confidently.

**A free tier that is not free.** `platform-github` said CodeQL is "free
for all repositories (public and private)". Code scanning on a private
repository requires GitHub Code Security, a paid add-on, and the API
declines the repository outright before any analysis starts. The damage
is not the sentence -- it is that the sentence reads as an assurance the
SAST row of the gate table is always satisfiable at no cost, so a private
project follows it and commits a workflow that can only be permanently
red or permanently skipped. A gate satisfied by appearance while scanning
nothing. The correction ships with a check that separates the two
refusals, because they send you to different places: `404 no analysis
found` means entitled and nothing has run, `403 Code Security must be
enabled` means not entitled at all.

**Two right rules with a gap between them.** Keep an elevated-scope scan
in its own workflow; fan in one required check. Both correct. A fan-in
job can only depend on jobs in its own workflow, so the isolated scan
cannot join it -- leaving it gating nothing, or holding a per-job entry
in branch protection, which is the stale list the fan-in rule exists to
prevent. The resolution is one required context per workflow rather than
one per repository, and it makes two existing statements false: the
fan-in rule's "sole required context", and the aggregator-timing note
telling a merge waiter to target *the* aggregator by name. Both were
corrected in the same pass. Adding the rule beside them would have left a
reader applying rules in order hitting the false one first.

**The measurement corrected the rule, again.** The migration settings
check was drafted with a pass condition predicting an "empty listing" for
a repository whose settings cannot be read. Run against one, it produces
`to_entries cannot be applied to: null` -- the field is returned only to
an administrator. The shipped wording names the actual message and says
it means the comparison never happened. Writing what a command will
probably print is not the same as running it.

**Re-homed by measurement, not by topic.** #1032 proposed its rule for
`ai-workflow`, which is where it belongs by subject and which resolves
into 0 of 17 stacks. `git.md` resolves into all 17, and a reader
performing a migration finds both migration rules together there. The
topically obvious home and the reachable one are different files more
often than is comfortable.

**A trigger fired before its own rule was written.** #1119 was open and
citing an ordinal count and a settings result in its body when #1118
merged, touching a neighbouring template and regenerating the same
seventeen chains. The branch went behind, was updated without a
force-push, and the merge was clean -- which proves the edits did not
overlap and says nothing about the result. The cited verification was
re-run rather than re-read, and `sync.py --check` confirmed the merged
templates still produce the committed output. That is #1025, applied to
itself while it was still an open issue.

**A rule paid for itself between being written and being merged.**
`gh pr checks` on the pull request carrying the full-SHA rule returned
"no checks reported on the branch". Selecting by full commit SHA at the
same instant returned `queued`. Two queries, one moment, one commit: one
said nothing had happened, the other named the state. Reading the first
as a workflow that never fired would have sent someone hunting a broken
trigger.

**The same issue was implemented twice, in parallel, by two people.**
#1049 was picked up here and in a separate session, landing as two
complete pull requests within minutes of each other. One merged, one was
closed as superseded. Nothing looks at the open pull request list before
starting a ticket, the same way nothing greps the tracker before filing
one -- and the second is already a recorded lesson. The wasted work was
small; the mechanism that produced it is not specific to this issue.

**A regression, caught by reading rather than by any gate.** The two
bullets added for the isolation gap were inserted between the fan-in rule
and its YAML example, orphaning the example under a bullet it does not
illustrate. Smoke passes, the markdown renders, nothing is malformed --
the only symptom is a reader taking the example for something it is not.
Found while opening the next pull request against the same region.

**Template feedback:** all reusable, all landed upstream. In
`base/core/git.md`: the migration checklist with its settings check, the
issue-cohort rule, the re-run-the-body's-verification rule, and what the
batch update cycle buys when members are not disjoint. In
`platform/github.md`: the CodeQL entitlement correction, the isolated
fan-in rule with its two corrected statements, and run selection by full
SHA. Nothing project-specific. Note `platform/github.md` resolves into no
stack chain at all -- it is orthogonal, chosen per project, so chain
reach says nothing about whether it travels.

**Releases:** v2.51.0 -- Repository migration and platform corrections, 8
issues. Tagged at commit `be4fe92` rather than at `main`, the first
release to use the rule added in the previous cut: naming the commit is
what keeps the journal entry outside the release it describes.

**PRs merged:** #1115, #1116, #1118, #1119, #1120, #1122 (and #1111,
#1112, #1114 from the previous session's close-out, which fall inside
this tag's range)

**Issues closed:** #1008, #1021, #1025, #1030, #1032, #1042, #1049, #1117

**Issues opened:** none this cut. #1110 and #1113, opened during the
previous one, remain open and unimplemented.

## 2026-08-26 -- Unconfirmed inputs (late night)

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Every issue in this cut is about confirming the input rather than
reading the output** -- the tree an issue described, the corpus a check
read, the text that actually shipped, and whether a derived artifact was
regenerated at all. Five issues, six pull requests.

**Three checks in one file, none of which said what it read.** The ADR
frontmatter check printed one line per non-conforming record and nothing
when the folder was clean, so a clean run and a run that reached no
records were identical -- in a repository whose own templates carry two
separate rules against exactly that. Grooming found the same shape in
both siblings. The journal check reported an empty result but never a
count. The width check reported neither, and it enumerates with
`git ls-files`, which reads the index: a document not yet staged is
invisible to it and the assertion passes having never seen it. All three
now report their input count and name zero as a failure.

**The width check found something on its first reporting run.** One line
in `README.md` at 89 characters against the declared 88, sitting there
since a pull request in the 400s. The check had always been able to find
it and had always run; what it could not do was say so. Nothing was
wrong with the assertion.

**An issue can be narrower than it reads.** #1107 proposed a rule for
meta-tests that enumerate a corpus. Most of it was already in
`testing-negative-assertion-coverage`, landed in v2.48 -- the input
coverage requirement, the insistence that the coverage assertion be a
real comparison rather than a printed number, the failure when a set
shrinks. Three bullets were genuinely missing, so three bullets is what
shipped, not the new section the issue reads as.

**And an issue can be wrong, including one filed the same day by the
person implementing it.** #1110 was written this morning from a real
observation: a trailing backslash had been dropped between author and
file, joining two lines of a shipped check. The proposed rule was that a
check MUST NOT use a line continuation. Measured before enforcing: 107
fenced blocks across the template tree, three lines ending in a
continuation, and all three intact -- a `curl` with headers piped through
three filters and a `jq` program over four fields, each the clearest form
for what it does. The rule as proposed would have flagged working
commands and demanded they be made worse. What shipped requires
confirming the continuation survived and prefers a form that needs no
confirmation. Being right that something broke does not make the proposed
remedy right.

**The check for it is a locator, not a detector.** Once a continuation is
lost the line is indistinguishable from one written joined, so nothing
can find it afterwards. The check reports where the risk is instead,
bounding the manual read to three lines rather than 107 blocks, and its
pass condition says a non-zero count is not a failure.

**A negative control broke on the phenomenon it was built to test.** The
planted file for that check reported zero continuations where one was
planted. The check was right; the control was wrong, because `printf`
mangled the backslash before it reached the file -- the exact silent loss
under test, reproducing itself one level up in the test harness.
Rebuilding the control in Python, bypassing the shell, made it
discriminate.

**A rule that dogfooded on its own pull request.** #1113 says regenerating
is owed by the edit rather than by the review, and that a staleness check
run before the edit reports the previous state and reads as a pass. The
change introducing it edits a core-tier template, so it left all
seventeen pre-resolved chains stale -- the precise failure, reproduced on
the pull request that fixes it, with `sync.py --check` reporting `STALE 17`
before the prescribed regeneration and `All files in sync` after.

**The last rule written was the one the other four had been following.**
#1102 asks that a filed issue be re-verified against the tree before it
is implemented. It was implemented last, after four issues in the same
cut had been groomed, and all three shapes it names had already occurred:
#1107 narrower than filed, #1103 wider than filed, #1110 wrong as filed.
`review.md` already required verifying a finding before REPORTING it and
said nothing about verifying a ticket before ACTING on it, which is the
same problem on the input side, so it landed as the sibling section.

**Template feedback:** all reusable, all landed upstream --
`base/core/docs.md` (three checks now self-reporting), `base/core/testing.md`
(the corpus guard as its own test), `base/workflow/quality-gates.md` (the
continuation rule and its locator), `base/core/git.md` (the regeneration
trigger), and `base/core/review.md` (verifying a filed issue). Nothing
project-specific except the one README line. Note the continuation rule
sits at 12/17 reach rather than 17/17, which is correct for its subject
and worth knowing.

**Releases:** v2.52.0 -- Unconfirmed inputs, 5 issues, 6 pull requests.

**PRs merged:** #1124, #1126, #1128, #1129, #1130, #1131

**Issues closed:** #1102, #1103, #1107, #1110, #1113

**Issues opened:** none. Both issues opened during the v2.50 cut were
closed here.

## 2026-08-26 -- Label check coverage

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**A one-issue cut, and the issue was found by running a check rather than
by reading one.** A label audit turned up nothing wrong with the labels:
93 open issues, every one carrying exactly one type and one priority, and
a label set matching the documented taxonomy name for name and colour for
colour. What it turned up was that the check saying so could not tell
that from having read nothing.

**The enforcement check had the defect the whole previous cut was
about.** `platform-github-labels` returns a JSON array of violations and
nothing else, so `[]` is the output whether it inspected every open issue
or none. Measured at one moment on one repository: the real run gave
`[]`, and the same filter forced to match nothing gave `[]`. Anything
that empties the listing -- an authentication failure, the wrong
repository context, a renamed label in the selector -- read as full
compliance. The check was added to stop unlabeled issues reaching the
tracker, and it had been reporting `[]` for months with nothing
distinguishing a healthy tracker from an unreachable one.

**Its cap was silent too.** `--limit 200` against 93 open issues and 598
ever: it has never truncated, and nothing would have reported it when it
did. A check that bounds its own input has to say what it dropped, or the
bound reads as coverage.

**Rewriting the form fixed three things at once.** The jq one-liner could
not carry a count and two guards without interpolating its limit into the
jq program, so it became a Python heredoc like every other shipped check
in the chain. That form reports the count naturally; it also joins the
corpus the embedded-check compile gate scans, which a shell one-liner
never did, taking that gate from nine checks to ten. And it removed one
of the three line continuations in the template tree, leaving two -- both
in a `curl` example where the continuation is genuinely the clearest
form, which is the reason the continuation rule requires confirming
survival rather than banning the construct.

**The mangled backslash struck a third time, in the search string.** The
replacement that rewrote this check would not match its own anchor,
because the anchor contained a trailing backslash and the authoring path
dropped it -- the same silent loss that produced the rule two cuts ago,
now defeating the edit rather than the output. Building the character
with `chr(92)` instead of writing it literally made the anchor match on
the first try. The rule says confirm the continuation survived into the
file; the corollary is that anything quoting such a line has the same
problem.

**A scope question answered in the template rather than in the issue.**
26 closed issues carry a type label and no priority, all closed between
18 April and 25 June, before the rule was enforced; everything closed
since conforms. The check could be widened to cover them and would then
produce 26 findings nobody should act on. It stays scoped to open issues,
and the template now says why: a triage label is terminal, so a closed
issue's labels are a record rather than a live claim.

**Template feedback:** reusable, landed upstream in
`platform/github.md`. Nothing project-specific. Note that `platform/`
resolves into no stack chain -- it is orthogonal, chosen per project, so
chain reach says nothing about whether it travels.

**Releases:** v2.53.0 -- Label check coverage, 1 issue, 1 pull request.
Fourth cut of the day.

**PRs merged:** #1135

**Issues closed:** #1134

**Issues opened:** #1134, filed and closed in the same cut, since the
evidence was one command and the fix was one check.

## 2026-08-26 -- What a record fixes

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Cut E shipped as v2.54.0 -- 12 issues, 7 pull requests, all in
`base/core/docs.md` and `base/core/readme.md`.** The backlog held five
separate issues that turned out to be one question asked five ways: what
part of a written record is fixed once it is written. `base-docs` had
made ADRs immutable and said nothing about the other records it requires
-- journal entries, dated reports, post-mortems.

**Five issues shipped as one pull request because the statements had to
agree.** Written independently they would have collided: the dated-report
issue asks for a stale instruction to be corrected by dated addendum,
while the Decision-logs section already forbids appending to a merged
record. Both are right, for different artifacts, and neither said so. The
new section states the general test once -- an edit that changes what the
record claims happened is an amendment and goes in a new record, one that
does not is a correction made in place -- and then says explicitly that
the addendum exists because a report has no supersession chain and is not
available on an ADR. Shipped as five pull requests, that collision lands
in the templates and a consumer resolves it by guessing.

**The mangled backslash struck again, on the first check drafted.** The
register-id check's regex used `\b` and `\d`; neither survived into the
draft. The word boundaries vanished silently and the digit class arrived
as a literal that only announced itself as a SyntaxWarning. This is the
same authoring-path loss recorded two cuts ago, now hitting a regex
rather than a line continuation. Reading the text back out of the file is
what caught it -- the draft looked correct at the point of writing. The
remedy that worked was removing every backslash from the pattern:
`(?<![A-Za-z0-9])(?:R|TD)[0-9]{2}(?![0-9])` needs none, and cannot lose
what it does not contain.

**Three checks shipped, each run against a negative control before
merge.** Register-id containment was run against a violating set, a clean
set, a set whose ids had drifted to another scheme, and a tree with no
arc42 docs at all -- the last two report zero and fail rather than
reading as a clean folder. The community-health check was run against
compliant-at-root, compliant-under-`.github/`, both-files-missing, and
one-file-duplicated. Its output is ASCII only, so it cannot fail on
encoding what it reports.

**A rule was landed that this repository does not satisfy.** The
community-health rule requires `SECURITY.md` of any public repository and
`CONTRIBUTING.md` of any repository accepting outside contributions. This
one is public with issues enabled and has neither -- the check run here
reports both absent. The rule was written to the principle rather than
tuned so the repository would pass, and the files were not added in the
same pull request: a disclosure policy and a contribution guide are
first-contact documents whose wording belongs to the owner, not a side
effect of stating a rule. Filed as #1147.

**Grooming against the tree changed one issue's shape again.** #997
quoted a version of the quality-goal bullet that no longer exists -- the
"Correctness" entry had already moved to the sub-characteristic list
since filing. What remained was the unnamed ISO 25010 edition and a 2011
characteristic set naming two categories the 2023 edition retired. The
membership half of the issue was untouched and shipped as filed. Second
consecutive cut in which reading the file first changed what got built.

**Template feedback:** all reusable, nothing project-specific. Landed
upstream in `base/core/docs.md` (record amendment, arc42 §5 and §11,
generated-artefact authority, community health files) and
`base/core/readme.md` (headline claims). Both are core tier, so every
rule here reaches all 17 chains.

**Releases:** v2.54.0 -- Docs & records, 12 issues, 7 pull requests. The
tag names 303c0d7, the release commit, so this entry sits outside the
release it describes.

**PRs merged:** #1139, #1141, #1142, #1143, #1144, #1145, #1146

**Issues closed:** #993, #995, #997, #998, #1001, #1002, #1003, #1017,
#1018, #1023, #1057, #1104

**Issues opened:** #1147, for the two community health files this
repository now owes itself.

## 2026-08-26 -- What a passing test proves

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Cut C shipped as v2.55.0 -- 8 issues, 7 pull requests, all in
`base/core/testing.md` apart from one bullet in `base/core/git.md`.**
The eight had one shape between them: the suite is green and the
evidence is about something other than the claim. A round trip through
your own codec proves the encoder and decoder agree. A check phrased
against a type identity tests the runtime. A fault the platform never
raises is a fault the suite never sees. A value the environment already
supplies passes before and after the fix. An invariant with no check
looks identical to one that holds.

**Every check was extracted from the committed file and run, and every
negative control was proven applied before it was trusted.** The
per-test resource grep reported 784 files inspected here with no hits,
then reported a seeded `type(self).port_counter += 1` read back from
disk. The autouse leak fixture was run under pytest against a thread
that outlives its test: the leaking test's own body passed -- `2 passed,
1 error` -- which is the shape the guard converts into a named culprit.
The AST comparison was run against a real `ruff format` over this
repository's `tools/`, which rewrote all three files and left all three
trees identical.

**One control existed to prove the normalisation was not decorative.**
The AST comparison declares that it collapses whitespace inside string
constants, and a rule that declares a normalisation is only as sound as
the normalisation actually doing something. Re-indenting a docstring by
eight spaces left the bytes different and the trees equal. Dropping a
`not` from `resolve.py` was reported against that file. Three runs, and
each answers a different question about the same command.

**A negative control refused to apply itself, which is the whole point
of asserting on the anchor.** The first attempt at the semantic break
searched for `if not path.exists():`, which is not in `resolve.py`. The
assertion stopped rather than seeding nothing and reporting a clean
comparison -- the exact failure the step exists to catch, met on the
first use.

**The issue's premise about the linter did not survive measurement, so
the rule states what the tool does.** #1076 held that ruff never asks
whether an `__all__` entry resolves. It does: `F822` exists for
precisely that, and reports an undefined entry in a plain module. It is
silent in `__init__.py`, where a package's export list actually lives,
because it cannot see names bound through submodules and declines to
guess. On a package re-exporting one name from a submodule and
advertising one that does not exist, `--select F822` returned "All
checks passed!" and the guard returned `['Missing']`. Written as filed,
the rule would have been enforced against a claim that is false half the
time; written from the measurement, it also tells a reader when the
guard is redundant -- Rust `pub use` and Go's capitalised identifiers
put the export where the compiler sees it.

**Two issues shipped as one pull request because they are the same
mistake.** #1009 and #1011 were filed separately, and #1011 says so in
its own body: both assert against your own environment instead of
against an external definition. They read as one section with one
opening paragraph, and would have read as two unrelated rules apart.

**Template feedback:** all reusable, nothing project-specific.
`base-testing` and `base-git` are both core tier, so all eight rules
reach 17/17 chains.

**Releases:** v2.55.0 -- What a passing test proves, 8 issues, 7 pull
requests. The tag names 4cf8e60, the release commit, so this entry sits
outside the release it describes.

**PRs merged:** #1151, #1152, #1153, #1154, #1155, #1156, #1157

**Issues closed:** #1009, #1010, #1011, #1013, #1019, #1027, #1047,
#1076

**Issues opened:** none.

## 2026-08-28 -- What the rule does not say

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Cut G shipped as v2.56.0 -- 6 issues, 6 pull requests, across
`platform/github.md`, `base/core/git.md` and `base/security/devsecops.md`.**
The six shared a shape: a rule that names a destination and not its
substance, or that contradicts another file. Where to attach an SBOM but
not what it must describe. A pass condition left behind by the check it
described. A release step assuming a milestone the platform rule forbids.
A link-check note covering the built-output case only. A concept no
template defined.

**Grooming against the tree changed three of the six before they were
built, and that is now the norm rather than the exception.** #1150
proposed retiring two clauses; running the committed check showed only
one was stale, because the rewritten check does still name each offender
and its counts. #1051's example passed a bare `./**/*.md`, which the
external-links note three paragraphs below already forbids -- and
`--exclude-path` turned out to take regular expressions rather than
paths, so a bare `docs` excludes every path containing that substring.
#724 asked for the security template and flagged the placement as open;
measurement moved it.

**A rule's home is decided by reach, and the topically obvious file was
wrong again.** `base/security/security.md` reaches 12 of 17 chains and
misses `python-lib`, `go-lib`, `nodejs-lib` and `c-embedded` -- exactly
the stacks where an unsupervised edit to a release workflow or a publish
config does its damage. It is also application security end to end:
input validation, authn, sessions, headers. Off-limits paths are agent
change-control, and they went to `base/core/git.md`, which is core tier
and already owns the one operation forbidden without escalation.

**The step-4 gate was not implementing the sentence above it.** It read
"verify that every issue closed since the previous tag carries the
milestone being released" and asked only whether an issue carried *a*
milestone, so an issue milestoned to a different release passed. Giving
it the declared milestone to compare against exposed a second defect
underneath.

**`gh` output was being decoded with the locale encoding, and it took a
title comparison to surface it.** `gh` emits UTF-8; `subprocess(text=True)`
decodes with the console code page. The same milestone title arrived as
34 characters with `U+2014` from a heredoc literal and an environment
variable, and as 36 characters with `U+0432 U+0402 U+201D` from `gh`. The
check reported a mismatch between a string and itself. Every call in the
step-4 check now passes `encoding="utf-8"`, and the one remaining call in
the chain -- the label conformance check -- was filed as #1164 and fixed
in the same cut. It is latent rather than harmless: measured against
`vuejs/core`, a non-ASCII label name comes back as four cp1251 characters
instead of one codepoint.

**An issue sat open for eleven releases because a pull request title used
a bare `#N`.** #987 was delivered in full by #990 and shipped in v2.45.0;
all three of its proposals are in `base-examples-index` today. The title
read `(#987, #988)`, and a bare `#987` is a reference rather than a
closing keyword -- the exact case `base/core/git.md` documents under
"Repeat the closing keyword before each issue number". It was closed
against v2.45, the release that actually shipped it, rather than the one
being cut. A sweep of every open issue against merged commit subjects
found one other mention, #618, which is a consumer deviation and
correctly open.

**The escape-eating class caught me twice more, in one session.** An
outer heredoc terminated early on the inner `EOF` of the check it was
carrying, and a `"\n"` needle written to replace a line did not survive
into the running script and matched zero times. The second was fixed by
building the needle with `chr(92)`, and the check it was editing now uses
`splitlines()` so it holds no backslash at all. The standing rule already
says a pattern holding no backslash cannot lose one; the new evidence is
that the rule applies to the throwaway script doing the edit, not only to
the check being shipped.

**A control that reaches nothing looks exactly like a control that
passes, twice.** A `gh.cmd` shim on `PATH` was resolved by
`shutil.which` and ignored by `subprocess.run`, because Windows
`CreateProcess` appends only `.exe` -- the check reported the same
`issues inspected: 81` with and without it. Driving it with `GH_REPO`
instead exercised it as it ships. Separately, the off-limits check
reported `files changed: 0` before its branch was committed, which is
what its own pass condition names a failure.

**One correction landed in this session's own record.** A pull request
body claimed six subprocess calls still decoded with the locale encoding;
a grep whose alternation matched each line twice produced the figure, and
the real count was one. Corrected in the body and in the squash message
before merge.

**Template feedback:** all reusable, nothing project-specific.
`base/core/git.md` is core tier, so off-limits paths and the release-gate
scoping reach 17/17. `devsecops.md` reaches 10/17 and `platform/github.md`
is orthogonal, chosen per project.

**Releases:** v2.56.0 -- What the rule does not say, 6 issues, 6 pull
requests. The tag names 14d6168, the release commit, so this entry sits
outside the release it describes.

**PRs merged:** #1162, #1163, #1165, #1166, #1167, #1169

**Issues closed:** #724, #1035, #1051, #1127, #1150, #1164; and #987
separately, against v2.45

**Issues opened:** #1164, for the last `gh` call decoding with the locale
encoding, fixed in the same cut.

## 2026-08-28 -- Where a tool name belongs

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Cut F shipped as v2.57.0 -- 8 issues, 7 pull requests, establishing
`base/language/` as the home for per-language tool selection and adding
`base/core/cli.md`.** The gate model already said stack templates map a
category to a concrete tool, then named `complexipy` and
`eslint-plugin-sonarjs` itself. `base/language/` existed for exactly this
and held one file, `typescript.md`, carrying style rules and no tooling
section at all.

**One dependency edge reached a whole family.** `stack-python-lib` is the
root every Python stack resolves through -- `python-service` through it,
`flask`/`fastapi`/`django` through `python-service`, `grpc-python`
directly -- so declaring `base-python` once reached 6/17. `stack-go-lib`
has the same shape and reached 4/17. Measuring the graph before choosing
the wiring turned what looked like six edits into one.

**The abstract layer's worst offender was not the file the issue named.**
#750 pointed at `quality-gates.md`. `base/core/quality.md` carried the
same inversion at core tier -- a nine-row table of TypeScript-only lint
rules that all seventeen chains resolved, including C and Go. Fixed in
the same pass, because leaving it would have contradicted ADR-027 the
moment it merged.

**A closed issue is not a delivered one.** #749 asked for a Go
complexity tool and was closed as a duplicate of #753 on the basis that
its tooling table would carry a Go row. It did not; #753 shipped Python
and TypeScript only. Stripping the abstract layer without adding
`base/language/go.md` would have left the Go stacks with a gate whose own
text says a tool MUST be named and nothing naming one.

**Running the example is what found it was broken.** The PEP 562 snippet
for #1077 compiled clean and raised `NameError` the moment it ran as a
real package `__init__` -- it used `TYPE_CHECKING` and `import_module`
without importing either, in the template and in the issue that proposed
it. `py_compile` passing is not the check; executing it is. The archive
listing for #1058 and the import assertion for #1077 were both run
against a deliberately broken case first, so each was shown to fail
before being trusted to pass.

**A shortcut re-created the hole the shipped check was written to
avoid.** Ad-hoc release-gate query read `milestone` off
`closingIssuesReferences`, a field that sub-object does not carry, and
reported `NONE` for all eight issues -- a uniform false negative. The
gate in `base/core/git.md` does a second `gh issue view` per issue for
precisely this reason. Extracting and running the committed one reported
9 pull requests and no mismatch.

**Two corrections landed mid-cut.** PR #1172 thinned `python-lib.md` but
left `Docstrings` and `Security` rows naming tools `base-python` already
bound, which is the re-declaration ADR-027 forbids; #1173 removed them
and the `go-lib.md` equivalent. Earlier in the same PR, thinning the
table first dropped the `gitleaks` row -- and since gitleaks is
language-agnostic, no language file owns it and nothing else in the chain
bound it. Restored to the stack with a line saying why it lives there.

**Template feedback:** all reusable, nothing project-specific.
`base/core/cli.md` is deliberately not core tier -- wired to the three
library roots that ship entry points, reaching 11/17. The six stacks
without it (htmx, astro, tutorial, express, nestjs, c-embedded) have no
entry point of this kind.

**Releases:** v2.57.0 -- Language and packaging, 8 issues, 7 pull
requests. The tag names 67e451a, the release commit, so this entry sits
outside the release it describes.

**PRs merged:** #1172, #1173, #1175, #1176, #1177, #1178, #1179

**Issues closed:** #750, #753, #755, #757, #815, #1034, #1058, #1077

**Issues opened:** #1174, for `c-embedded` having no quality-gates
section and C no language file -- the only stack family left without one
after this cut.

## 2026-08-28 -- What the check measures

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Cut D shipped as v2.58.0 -- 10 issues, 8 pull requests, closing the gap
between a check that runs cleanly and a check that answers the question
the claim is about.** Eight separate observations turned out to share one
shape: a false zero, a measurement taken at the wrong scope, a probe run
as the wrong principal, a planted break nobody proved had landed, a family
of absence checks with no shared control, a floor with no derivation, a
scan that flagged the comment recording its own fix, and a staleness gate
that could not see its own subject.

**The cut's own theme caught the cut, twice.** Rewriting `sync.py` by
anchored replacement failed on an anchor containing `"\n"`: the two
characters in the file became one newline in the search string, so the
anchor never matched and the edit silently did nothing. The assertion
fired before the write, so the file was untouched -- but the same slip
inside a successful edit would have shipped. The redo used a placeholder
token substituted for `chr(92)` at the end, so no backslash appeared in
the editing script at all. Then the journal entry describing that failure
was written the unsafe way and broke on the same escape, mid-sentence,
inside the sentence naming it. Seventh and eighth recorded instances of
the mode. Reading the text back out of the file is what caught both, as
it has caught every one of them.

**A guard that fires is worth more than a guard that passes.** The chain
generator refuses an unknown stack id, and it refused one immediately:
`load_manifest` returns `stacks` as a *list of dicts*, so `stack_id not in
stacks` was always true. Without the guard the block would have rendered
empty -- a fenced code block containing nothing, which reads as a real
result and is exactly the drift the generator exists to prevent.

**Measuring the historical drift needed three attempts, each failing
differently.** Counting the pre-correction example blocks first over-ran
its bounds -- the last block had no following delimiter, so the count swept
`templates/` lines out of later sections and reported 28 where the truth
was 21. The fix over-corrected onto the wrong fence and returned 0 for
every block, the reached-nothing signature. Only the third, indexing
explicit fence pairs, reproduced the issue's numbers exactly. A one-file
correction to `review.md` in this same cut says a count carrying a finding
is produced twice by different means; writing that rule and then needing
it three times in an hour is the strongest argument for it available.

**The staleness gate repairs what it reports on.** `_update_file` has no
`check_mode` guard, so `sync.py --check` writes the files it is checking.
The first invocation reported `1 file(s) out of sync` and exited 1; a
second, moments later, reported clean and exited 0, because the first had
already rewritten the file. Read straight, the pair says the gate is
flaky. It is not, it is destructive -- and every negative control of a
marker has to specify a single fresh invocation. Pre-existing and
affecting every marker rather than the one added here, so it was filed
(#1192) rather than folded in.

**An accepted decision retired a filed acceptance criterion.** #1159 asked
for the mutation-testing tool mapping in the `python-*`, `go-*` and JS/TS
stack templates. ADR-027 was accepted after the issue was filed and moved
per-language tool selection into `base/language/`, forbidding the abstract
gate from naming a tool at all. Implementing the criterion as written
would have contradicted a decision merged eight commits earlier. The
mapping went to the language layer instead, which reaches wider: one
binding on `stack-python-lib` covers six stacks.

**Five negative controls on one two-line grep.** The fix for #1181 adds
`^[^#]*` so the unique-resource scan skips lines where the pattern is
discussed rather than used. The controls that mattered were not the
obvious two. Running the *old* pattern against the clean corpus proved the
fix was load-bearing rather than decorative; a real allocation carrying a
trailing `# noqa` proved the guard had not been over-applied; and an empty
tree proved the "a zero count means the path is wrong" condition still
discriminated.

**A zero is not always drift.** The test-edit boundary check reports zero
when a change touches no tests at all, which is a real answer needing no
escalation -- the opposite reading from `quality-gates-check-runs`, where
an empty result means the enumeration broke. The section says so
explicitly rather than letting the file's general rule be read onto it.

**PRs merged:** #1185, #1186, #1187, #1188, #1189, #1190, #1191, #1193

**Issues closed:** #1022, #1039, #1043, #1140, #1159, #1160, #1161, #1168,
#1181, #1183

**Issues opened:** #1192, for `sync.py --check` writing the files it is
checking.

**Also this session:** #1181 was labelled `bug`/`P2` on the #979
precedent -- a shipped check producing a false positive is a defect, not a
task -- which returned the repository's own label conformance check to
`[]`.

## 2026-08-28 -- What nobody is watching

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**Cut H shipped as v2.59.0 -- 13 issues, 9 pull requests, and the last of
the eight proposed cuts.** One shape ran through all of them: a condition
written down once and then never read again. A revisit trigger with
nothing polling it. A deferral whose trigger had already fired when the
issue was written. An issue overtaken by an open pull request, and by a
decision accepted after it was filed. An unenforced step standing beside
a gated one. A comment naming a construct that was wrong everywhere. A
sweep bounded by its inputs rather than by what it had created.

**Three of nine placements went somewhere other than where the issue
asked, each decided by one measurement.** `resolve.py` puts
`workflow/ai-workflow.md` in 0 of 17 chains, `workflow/scope.md` and
`workflow/issues.md` in 1 each, and every core-tier file in all 17. So
the rejected-mechanism sweep went to `quality.md` rather than to
`ai-workflow-read-edit-site`, plan-first to `review.md` rather than to
`scope.md`, and the trigger-watcher cluster split in two -- the general
obligation into `quality.md`, the issue-body mechanics into `issues.md`,
with no sentence living in both. The correct-but-partial case stayed in
`ai-workflow.md` regardless, because it is the third case of a
three-case contrast and the other two are there.

**The cut's own rule found its own instance within the hour.** The new
`quality-gates-procedure-steps` says a procedure mixing gated and
ungated steps reads as enforced throughout, and asks for a step-by-step
audit. Run against this repository's release runbook, that audit found
four of eight steps enforced by nothing -- and the failure had already
happened. `v2.57.0` was tagged, its milestone closed, its journal entry
written, and the release never cut. Step 5 alone was missed, which is
invisible precisely because every other artifact of that release is
present.

**v2.57.0 stays absent, deliberately.** Its tag is timestamped 36
minutes before v2.58.0's release was published, so cutting it now would
place it above v2.58.0 in a list ordered by publication date, and a
mis-ordered release list is worse than a visibly absent entry. The
runbook now carries the reason beside the step that was skipped, and a
closing step 8 that verifies the release exists -- placed last rather
than inside step 5, because a check inside a step is skipped whenever
the step is.

**A guard fired on the extractor rather than on the check.** Pulling the
pre-release check out of `git.md` to run it, the extractor took the
first heredoc block in the file and asserted its body defined
`MILESTONE`. It does not: `git.md` holds three such blocks and the first
is the numbering-collision check. Selecting by position had found a real
block that answers a different question, which is the check-selection
failure the templates already describe. Selecting by content fixed it,
and the assertion is the only reason it was not run against the wrong
subject.

**No escape was lost this session, for the first time in several cuts.**
Every pattern written into a file was chosen to hold no backslash at all
-- `[0-9]` for a digit, `([^0-9]|$)` for the boundary after an issue
number, `[Cc]loses` for the case fold. A pattern holding no backslash
cannot lose one. That last character class earned itself immediately:
without it, a search for issue 104 matches a body closing 1041.

**Both new checks were extracted from the committed file and run against
controls.** The pull-request query matched #1198 on a body closing
#1041, reported the 20 pull requests it had inspected, and did not match
#104. The decision-record query listed ADR-004, ADR-026 and ADR-027 as
touched since 2026-08-20; a future date and a mistyped directory printed
the same nothing, which is why its pass condition asks for one run
without `--since` to prove the path resolves.

**PRs merged:** #1198, #1199, #1200, #1201, #1202, #1203, #1205, #1206,
#1207

**Issues closed:** #725, #748, #985, #994, #1000, #1036, #1038, #1041,
#1052, #1133, #1137, #1195, #1196

**Issues opened:** #1208, for the pre-release checklist in `git.md`,
which has not had the enforcement audit this cut's own rule requires and
resolves into all 17 chains; and #1209, for the four deferred issues in
this repository that name a trigger and no mechanism that would detect
it.

**Also this session:** #1204 was filed from a parallel session carrying
no labels, so the repository's label conformance check returns `[1204]`
rather than `[]`. Left for its author, since choosing its type and
severity is a triage decision rather than a correction.

## 2026-08-28 -- The run that proves nothing

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**v2.60.0 shipped 9 issues across 8 pull requests, the first cut scoped
straight from the backlog rather than from the A-to-H order, which v2.59
exhausted.** One shape ran through all of them: a check or a record that
ran, came back clean, and answered about a different moment or a
different subject than the claim it was used for.

**The timing rule had one home, and it was the wrong one.** "Run the
staleness comparison AFTER the edit" existed once, scoped to regenerated
artifacts, while two other checks in this same cut needed it and
inherited nothing. It is now `quality-gates-check-timing`, the fourth
member of the family beside pair-check, procedure-steps and check-runs --
a constraint with no check, an unenforced step beside an enforced one, a
check never run, and now a check run at the wrong moment.

**The off-limits false clean was demonstrated on the branch that fixed
it.** With the edit sitting uncommitted, the shipped check reported
`files changed: 0`; after the commit, 18. The check compares
`origin/main...HEAD`, so the natural moment to run it -- while writing
the change -- is the one moment it is guaranteed to report nothing. Its
pass condition named a wrong base and an empty branch and not that.

**The staleness gate repaired what it inspected, measured both ways.**
A planted line inside a generated marker, then `--check` twice, tracking
the file's digest. Before the fix: run 1 printed `SYNC`, exited 1 and
restored the digest; run 2 printed `All files in sync` and exited 0.
After: both runs print `STALE`, both exit 1, the digest never moves.
SYS-09 pins it.

**The escape loss struck again, and Python caught it this time.** A
two-character backslash-n written inside a heredoc-embedded Python string
arrived in `run_smoke.py` as a real newline, producing an unterminated
string literal. The fix is the one already recorded: put a token in the
text and substitute the backslash at the very end, so no backslash
appears anywhere in the editing script. It was used for both new checks
after that, and the literals were read back out of the file each time.

**Two negative controls, and only the second one mattered.** SYS-09 run
against the pre-fix tool failed on the signature -- a weak control, since
it says nothing about behaviour. Run against a tool that accepts
`check_mode` and ignores it, the shape a careless later edit takes, it
failed with the message that matters. The same discipline applied to
SYS-10, where the pre-fix whole-file scan extracts both the backticked
occurrence and the fenced one.

**A fix that changes nothing measurable needs a control to be visible at
all.** Restricting the DEPENDS ON extraction to the file header is a
no-op on the current tree: with the old whole-file scan planted back,
SYS-01 and SYS-04 still pass, because nothing in the tree quotes the
directive any more. The workaround held by accident, and SYS-10 is the
only thing that now demonstrates the fix is load-bearing. The
restriction is exact rather than approximate -- all 41 declarations
across 75 template files sit on line 2, 3 or 4, and none appears twice.

**A cross-file rule reference costs reach, twice caught.**
`core/git.md` resolves into 17 chains and `workflow/quality-gates.md`
into 12, so a reference from the first to a rule ID in the second dangles
for five chains. Both drafts that carried one had it removed and the
substance stated inline.

**Editing a template made seven committed examples stale, and nothing
reports it.** The end-of-session audit moved its journal item to
second-from-last, in the template and in this repository's own CLAUDE.md,
which carried the same defect. Seven examples inline that audit with the
old order. They are agent-generated under ADR-016, so they are
regenerated rather than edited -- filed as #1220, blocked on an API key.
SYS-05 asserts the enforcement phrase survives into every example and
says nothing about item order, so all 25 checks pass with the examples
disagreeing with the template they came from.

**PRs merged:** #1214, #1216, #1217, #1218, #1219, #1221, #1222, #1223

**Issues closed:** #979, #980, #1192, #1197, #1204, #1208, #1211, #1212,
#1213

**Issues opened:** #1213, filed and shipped in the same cut since the
rule it asks for is what the other two checks needed; #1220, for the
seven examples now stale against the reordered audit; and, from the
wrap-up audit that ran after this entry was first written, #1226 (a rule
naming another file's section ID can be unreadable in chains that resolve
it — 33 such references measured, 5 dangling, one of them written in this
very cut), #1227 (a negative control can fire and still prove nothing)
and #1228 (the runbook writes the journal before the wrap-up audit runs,
which is why this line needed extending at all).

**Also this session:** v2.59.0 was cut earlier in the day, then the
backlog was groomed -- three of the four deferred issues turned out to
have fired triggers, two of them since v2.45, and #979 and #980 came into
this cut because of it. Four issues arrived from a parallel session
(#1204, #1211, #1212, #1215) and were labelled on the way past; #1215
proposes a sixth shape for the verifying-a-filed-issue section and is
unmilestoned.

## 2026-08-28 -- Where the rule stops short

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**v2.61.0 shipped 6 issues across 4 pull requests, scoped from a groom
rather than from a theme chosen first.** One shape ran through all of
them: a rule that is correct, and whose reach ends one step before its
own apparatus -- three MUSTs that name no check while the bullet above
them does, a continuation rule that governs writing such a line but not
quoting one, a floor-sizing rule that does not reach the control's own
floor.

**Grooming changed four issues before a line was written.** #1215 cites
a shapes table as having three rows; it has five, two added since it was
filed, so it lands as a sixth row rather than a fourth -- and the issue
is a live instance of the defect it describes, since its citation was
accurate when written and still resolves. #303's recorded blocker was
wrong. #727 claims library and service chains get no OOP guidance, and
all eight service chains resolve it; the omission is libraries, gRPC and
c-embedded. #976 cites a step number that has moved. Four of the
forty-one unmilestoned issues, found by measuring rather than reading.

**The unreachable set is 21 templates, not the five on record, and they
are not orphans.** 17 are named in no DEPENDS ON header anywhere. But
`docs/SPEC.md` already declares such templates orthogonal by design and
excluded from reachability checks, so the check #303 asks for is not
blocked on the orthogonality spike. It is blocked on the exclusion list
existing in machine-readable form: the manifest carries no orthogonal
marker, and SPEC's prose list names 8 of the 21. This also explains the
sharpest instance in #1226. `core/git.md` naming `base-360` dangles in
all 17 chains because `360.md` is orthogonal, so no chain can ever
resolve it and the fix is to inline the substance rather than adjust
reach.

**The first version of the new check was wrong, and the rule that caught
it is already in the templates.** The comment-layout check began as a
line scan and flagged fifteen usage examples inside module docstrings,
where a hash is prose in a string and not a comment. `review.md`
requires running what an issue proposes against the tree before adopting
it, on the grounds that a rule flagging correct code is a wrong rule
rather than an under-enforced one. Rewritten over `tokenize`, which is
the reasoning the ASCII-identifier rule in the same section already
gives for its own check. It then found 31 true positives here.

**Extending a rule falsified a claim inside it.** The continuation rule
asserted it covered the one break mode that fails neither loudly nor
closed, and that every other break mode announces itself. A vanished
word boundary does neither: it compiles, runs, and silently matches
wider than written. The uniqueness claim went and the confirmation
generalised to the family. A rule can be right about what to do and
wrong about how far it reaches, and the second half is the part nothing
re-reads.

**The file's own checks broke the rule the file was gaining.** Both
embedded checks in `quality-gates.md` depended on escapes surviving: two
patterns whose loss would have matched a literal letter at line start,
and three string escapes equally quiet. All five are now written without
a backslash, so neither check can lose one. Proved behaviour-neutral by
output diff rather than by the suite staying green, at 14 embedded
checks and 126 fenced blocks before and after, byte-identical. A
substitution inside a working check has to show it changed nothing, and
a passing suite does not show that.

**This repository fails two of the checks it ships.** Running the
community-health check out of `templates/base/core/docs.md`, to validate
an extraction pattern before copying it, reported SECURITY.md and
CONTRIBUTING.md absent. That is #1147, open since 26 August, now with an
embedded gate demonstrating it rather than a rule citing it. The
comment-layout check found 31 violations in `tests/` and `tools/`, filed
as #1233. Both were kept out of their pull requests: the concern was
giving a rule its check, not fixing what the check then found.

**The check-selection trap reproduced exactly as recorded.**
`core/git.md` holds three heredoc blocks and only one defines MILESTONE,
so the pre-release and ordering checks had to be located by asserting on
a distinguishing string in the body. Both release gates were extracted
that way. It also surfaced why: the file labels its checks against its
own seven-step sequence while the PLAYBOOK numbers the same release in
eight, and two labels inside the one file both say step 5 for different
sequences. Filed as #1237.

**The journal was written last on purpose, and that is why this entry
can name #1242.** #1228 is open: the PLAYBOOK writes the entry at
release step 7, before the wrap-up audit runs, so audit items that file
issues land after it is merged. Last session that forced an in-place
amendment. Writing it after the audit instead cost nothing and needed no
second record.

**PRs merged:** #1232, #1234, #1235, #1236

**Issues closed:** #989, #1004, #1138, #1149, #1225, #1227

**Issues opened:** #1233, this repository breaking the comment-layout
rule it ships across 31 sites; #1237, the release runbook and its checks
numbering the same procedure two ways; and #1242, three workflows the
PLAYBOOK does not carry, including grooming. The last two came from the
wrap-up audit that ran before this entry was written.

**Also this session:** the backlog was groomed first and the cut fell
out of it, with 41 unmilestoned issues re-measured against the tree and
24 annotated with what was found. A sweep of every commit subject in
history for issues still open returned one hit, already correctly
parked, so the #987 class has not recurred. #1233, #1237 and #1242 are
unmilestoned. #1242 records that the groom procedure and the sweep are
both reusable and belong in `base/workflow/issues.md`, not only in this
repository's PLAYBOOK.

## 2026-08-28 -- The instruction its own text cannot show is incomplete

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**v2.62.0 shipped 5 issues across 3 pull requests, plus a decision record
and this entry.** The theme fell out of the groom rather than being chosen
first, for the third cut running. Every issue in it was an instruction
that was incomplete in a way its own text could not reveal: a step that
fires before the work it records, a number pointing into a different
document's sequence, a reference to a section the reader's chain does not
carry, a classification with a branch missing, and three procedures run
every cut that nobody had written down.

**The runbook wrote the journal before the audit that produces its
content.** #1212 had already moved the entry to the end of the wrap-up
audit, because it is the only item whose output is a record of the others.
The PLAYBOOK reintroduced the same defect one level up: step 7 of *Release
a new version* wrote the entry, and a session that cut a release then ran
the audit filed issues the merged entry could not name. Last session that
forced an in-place amendment. Step 7 now records that the entry is owed
and names the audit item that writes it, and states that a release without
a wrap-up still owes one. This entry is the first written under the
corrected ordering by rule rather than by hand, which is why it can name
#1248 and #1249 -- both filed at audit item 12, after the release was
published.

**Two documents numbered the same procedure differently, and one file
numbered two procedures the same.** The PLAYBOOK runs the release in eight
steps and `core/git.md` in seven, so "the check for step 7" named
different steps depending on which document the reader had open. Worse,
`git.md` carried two checks both labelled "The check for step 5" -- one in
the release sequence, one under repository migration. Each embedded check
now has a name (milestone-coverage, pipeline-history, release-ordering,
security-controls) and both documents refer to it by that name. The rule
stating why sits above the first check, because a consuming project's
runbook will not share either numbering. Both release gates for this cut
were then located by asserting on a distinguishing string in the body,
which is the method the rule now requires.

**A reference costs reach, and the file that proved it was one I wrote.**
A rule naming another template's section in running prose is not a
directive, so nothing resolves or checks it -- but the two files sit at
different depths in the graph, so it reads correctly in the chains
carrying both and dangles in the rest. Measured: 15 such references, 3
dangling. `core/git.md` resolves into 17 chains and `core/examples.md`
into 11, so a reference between them is unreadable in six. The worst named
a section in a template that resolves into no chain at all, unreadable in
all 17 -- and it had been added knowingly, hours after two others were
removed for exactly this reason. Understanding a constraint is not the
same as writing it down. It is now ADR-028, SPEC.md, a line in CLAUDE.md,
and SYS-11.

**The new check caught its own breakage before it caught anything else.**
SYS-11 counts the chains it resolves and the references it matches before
reporting, because a check that reaches nothing and a clean tree print the
same empty result. An early draft keyed section IDs by tuple and compared
absolute paths against manifest-relative ones, so it reached nothing --
and the reference count is what reported it. Without that assertion the
check would have gone green while checking nothing, on its very first run.
Two negative controls were then run deliberately: a planted dangling
reference, which fails and names the 12 chains it is absent from; and the
match pattern altered to `baze-` so it still compiles and matches nothing,
which fails on the count rather than passing. The second is the shape a
careless later edit takes and is the control that matters.

**The sixth shape is the one found only by disagreeing with a criterion
you are meant to satisfy.** `base-review` listed five shapes a filed issue
takes; all five are found by comparing the issue to the tree. The sixth is
an issue whose acceptance criteria carry a closed classification -- each
of these is either A or B, and the Bs are deleted -- meeting a member that
is neither. Nothing about such an issue is false; the taxonomy is simply
incomplete, and an absent branch leaves no trace in the text. It is the
most dangerous of the six because the criteria read as a checklist and a
checklist invites completion, and forcing a member into the nearest branch
produces a diff that looks exactly like the intended work.

**A cited command that does not exist reads as a clean gate.** #1242
proposed re-running `py tools/sync.py --check` and `py tools/resolve.py
--check` after recovering a branch that went BEHIND. `resolve.py` has no
`--check`: given one it falls through to `--list`, prints the stack IDs
and exits 0. The command as filed would have passed while checking
nothing. `sync.py --check` already covers `generated/` and is the whole
gate. This is the verify-the-issue's-claims step from the groom procedure
catching something in the very issue that asked for that step to be
written down.

**PRs merged:** #1244, #1246, #1247, #1250

**Issues closed:** #1226, #1228, #1237, #1241, #1242

**Issues opened:** #1248, the groom procedure and the merged-commit sweep
being reusable and having landed only in this repository's PLAYBOOK, which
#1242's own text asked for and this cut did not do; and #1249, a branch
that goes BEHIND carrying stale regenerated artifacts while Git reports it
MERGEABLE -- `base-git` already has the recovery mechanism and not the
reason it matters. Both from audit item 12.

**Also this session:** the backlog was groomed first, 44 unmilestoned
issues re-measured against the tree, and two clusters fell out. The one
not taken -- two templates resolving into one chain and wanting opposite
things from the same file -- stays intact for the next cut: #1238, #1239,
#1240, #1230, #1231. Three groom measurements corrected a filed claim:
#1233 counts 25 trailing comments rather than 31, #1226's dangling set is
3 of 15 rather than the 5 of 33 recorded earlier, and #1242's cited
`resolve.py --check` does not exist. ADR-028 was written after the tag,
so v2.62.0 carries the rule and not its record.

## 2026-08-28 -- The question a resolved chain leaves unsettled

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**v2.63.0 shipped 5 issues across 4 pull requests, the second cut of the
day.** It was scoped in the v2.62 groom and held intact, which is the first
time a cut has been planned one release ahead and shipped unchanged. The
theme is what a consumer's resolved chain does not settle: three cases
where two rules answer the same question differently, and two where no rule
answers it at all.

**A conflict invisible from either file.** `base-cli` claims any executable
entry point; an example is executable, is an entry point, and is none of
the three things the scope names. The two readings produce opposite work --
`base-cli-plumbing` factors each example's body into a shared module, while
`base-examples` asks for one file per pattern, and `base-cli-main` wants an
`argv` seam that an example verified by a smoke run does not use. Both
templates resolve into the same 11 chains and neither named the other, so
the conflict was reachable only by reading them side by side. The scope
paragraph now excludes the directory and says why, because an outcome
without its reasoning invites the next edit to undo it.

**A directory cannot be the home for files that must not be committed.**
`base-examples` called `scripts/` the home for throwaway probes;
`base-quality` says a probe never lands on main. Together they left the
directory unowned, and the downstream outcome was seven files of which five
were dead. What `scripts/` actually holds is maintained tooling that is not
shipped. Eligibility came out as three grounds rather than the two the
issue proposed -- invoked by a documented command, executed by CI, or
imported by a file that is -- because a rule with only the first two
deletes a live helper module. That is the sixth shape from last cut,
applied to an issue filed this cut.

**Placement was decided by measurement three times.** ADR-028 landed hours
earlier, and every rule in this cut had to choose a file under it. The
`scripts/` rule went into `quality.md` (17 chains) with `examples.md` (11)
deferring, because the other direction leaves six consumers holding the
deferral and not the rule. The suppression rule could name `base-quality`
because every chain carrying `quality-gates.md` carries `quality.md`. The
changelog rule could not cite the pair-a-rule-with-a-check requirement,
which dangles in five, so it states it inline. A rule written a few hours
before became the thing that shaped where four rules live.

**The freeze answered one question and the escape beside it was
undocumented.** A per-file lint freeze says "this file was already broken
on adoption day". Nothing said "this rule is wrong at this line", so the
only moves were adding the file to the table -- which the same rule forbids
and which suppresses the rule for every other line in it -- or an
undocumented suppression with no stated form. The only `# noqa` anywhere in
the templates was the comment-layout exception. A site-local suppression
must now name its rule, because a bare one silently absorbs every rule that
later applies to the line and a named one keeps failing on the next
finding.

**The check matched its own pattern table.** The bare-suppression check
scanned whole lines, so run against a tree containing itself it reported
nine findings where four were real, five being its own list of the tokens
it searches for. It now reads only the comment half of each line. Nothing
about the check looked wrong; extracting it from the committed template and
running it somewhere it could see itself is what showed it.

**Where a class is unspecified and its neighbour is not, it inherits the
neighbour's voice.** Nothing in the base layer shaped a changelog entry --
the word appears in seven templates and only `stack/nodejs-lib` carried a
rule. The failure does not present as a missing rule but as a changelog
that reads like whatever else the project writes, and the development
journal, specified in detail, sits one section away. Measured downstream:
16 of 37 entries over 40 words, the longest at 142. The bound is now 40
words with a check, and the journal relationship is stated, since those
rules are what fill the vacuum when this one is absent.

**Two rules shipped today are violated by this repository.** `base-docs`
now requires `CHANGELOG.md` of a project that publishes versions; this repo
has 63 tags, a published release for nearly all of them, and no such file.
Filed as #1257 -- with the prior question attached, because the rule does
not say whether generated release notes discharge it, and the two answers
produce different work. That makes three rules this repository ships and
does not satisfy, each found by hand after the rule merged. #1258 says the
obvious thing: nothing runs the templates' embedded checks against this
tree, and the composition suite does not attempt to.

**PRs merged:** #1252, #1253, #1255, #1256

**Issues closed:** #1230, #1231, #1238, #1239, #1240

**Issues opened:** #1257, the changelog requirement being unsatisfied here
and ambiguous about hosted release notes; and #1258, nothing running the
templates' own checks against this repository, which is the pattern behind
#1147, #1233 and #1257 alike. Both from audit item 12.

**Also this session:** the second pull request went BEHIND, which is the
case documented in the PLAYBOOK earlier the same day -- `gh pr
update-branch`, then the staleness gate re-run on the merged result, both
clean. Two groom corrections: #1240's claim that the security half was
already solved and could be copied is half right, since `base-devsecops`
carries the principle and none of the three concrete properties; and the
shell working directory persisted across a check run and produced a
false-negative, which is the trap this repository's own session protocol
warns about, met while validating a check about traps.

## 2026-08-28 -- Session close-out after v2.63.0

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**This is the second record for the session the entry above describes, and
it exists because the wrap-up audit ran twice.** The first pass ran when
v2.63.0 was tagged and produced #1257 and #1258, which that entry names.
The session then continued, and the explicit end-of-session audit produced
two more things it cannot name. `base-docs` fixes a record in what it
claims rather than in its bytes, so adding them to the entry above would be
an amendment and belongs in a new record instead of an in-place edit.

**Item 6 found a decision made three times and written down nowhere.**
ADR-028 records the constraint on cross-file references. The placement
heuristic it implies -- measure both candidate files' chain reach and put
the rule in the wider one, leaving the narrower to defer -- was applied
three times during v2.63 and stated in neither the ADR nor CLAUDE.md. It is
now one line in CLAUDE.md 2.7, which is the right home by the every-turn
test: an agent adding a rule to a template has to make the call before
writing a line.

**Item 12 found a check-authoring failure that every existing control
misses.** The rules about proving a check work are all about reach -- did
it run, did it see its inputs, would it fail if the defect were present. A
check that matches its own source fails in the opposite direction, and
every reach-oriented control reports healthy while it does. The
bare-suppression check shipped in v2.63 hit this: run from a directory
containing its own extracted copy it reported nine findings where four were
real, the other five being the lines of the tuple listing the tokens it
searches for. Filed as #1260, with the quieter variant named too -- a
self-match that produces a passing result verifies nothing and looks like a
clean tree.

**The ordering rule fixed this morning assumes the audit runs once.**
#1228 moved the journal out of the release procedure and into the audit,
because the audit produces work the entry must name. It does not say what
to do when a session runs the audit more than once, which is what happened
here: a release wrap-up followed by an explicit end-of-session one. Filed
as #1262. The rule is right and its edge is unspecified, which is the same
shape as the five issues v2.63 shipped.

**PRs merged:** #1261

**Issues opened:** #1260, a check matching its own source with no rule
telling an author to test for it; and #1262, the journal ordering rule
being silent on a session whose audit runs twice.

**Also this session:** the audit confirmed no update was needed for
README.md, docs/ONBOARDING.md or templates/manifest.yaml -- no command,
prerequisite or template registration changed across either cut -- and that
CLAUDE.md 6.3 and the rewritten PLAYBOOK step 7 now agree on when the
journal is written.

---

## 2026-08-29 -- The rules turned on their author

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**The session groomed the backlog, scoped v2.64 from what the groom found,
and shipped five of its seven issues.** No cut was pre-scoped going in --
v2.62 and v2.63 had exhausted both clusters the v2.62 groom produced -- so
the PLAYBOOK's groom procedure ran first and the theme fell out of it
rather than being chosen: this repository is a consumer of its own base
tier, and nothing had ever run the rules it publishes against it.

**Key changes.** `base-quality` gained the self-match failure and its test,
and its comment-layout check stopped flagging a comment placed first inside
a block or a bracketed literal. `base-docs` settled whether generated
release notes discharge the `CHANGELOG.md` requirement -- they do not --
and gained the clause for a project adopting the file after it has already
published versions. `base-git` gained a changelog-completeness check and
now names the changelog in both release sequences. This repository's own
comment layout came into conformance in 29 places, and it carries a
`CHANGELOG.md` for the first time across 65 tags.

**PRs merged:** #1264, #1265, #1266, #1268 for the cut; #1271 and #1272
from the wrap-up audit. **PRs open and deliberately unmerged:** #1269,
which needs the owner's word on a disclosure route, an acknowledgement
window and whether to carry a code of conduct, and #1270, stacked on it so
the conformance runner lands green.

**Issues closed:** #1245, #1233, #1260, #1257, #1254. **Issues created:**
#1273 and #1274, both from the audit. **Decisions:** ADR-029 on the
changelog, merged; ADR-030 on running the shipped checks here, waiting on
#1270.

**The groom is what made the cut coherent, and one measurement changed the
plan.** #1233 was filed as 31 comment-layout violations. Re-measured, 31
reproduced but only 29 were real -- the other two were #1245's
false-positive shape, present in this tree. So #1245 had to land first;
applied in the other order the conformance fix would have inserted blank
lines after `if val == "":` and `for e in entries:`, moving two correct
comments into the shape the rule forbids everywhere else. Two issues that
looked independent were strictly ordered, and only measuring showed it.

**The same measurement nearly went wrong in the other direction.** A first
pass at classifying #1245's false positives treated any trailing comma as
the same shape and reported 11. Nine of those were real -- the `],` then
comment shape that #1233 itself quotes as its commonest true positive. An
exemption written against trailing punctuation rather than an opening
bracket would have absorbed nine findings silently. The rule that landed
therefore says to constrain by the pattern's position, not its
neighbourhood.

**Lesson: an extraction that under-counts is indistinguishable from a clean
one.** Measuring the corpus of embedded checks for #1258, the first run
anchored its fence pattern to column 0 and missed every indented block --
32 where the real number is 44, a 26% shortfall. It produced no symptom: a
plausible total, a plausible per-file table, and a correct top entry. It
was caught only because a second extraction for a different purpose
disagreed about one file. So #1258's acceptance criterion was strengthened
before it was implemented: reporting how many checks you extracted is not
enough, because the wrong run reports its count with equal confidence. The
runner now parses fenced blocks in every language and reconciles the
runnable subset against that wider total.

**Lesson: a check whose unit is finer than its rule's unit reports the
wrong thing at full confidence.** The changelog rule bounds an entry at 40
words and its shipped check measured physical lines. Against the first
changelog ever written to that rule -- this repository's -- it reported
`entries over the limit: 0` while three entries ran to 45, 41 and 42 words.
Any file wrapped to any column defeats it. The unit is now the entry plus
its continuation lines.

**The conformance runner earned its place on its first run.** The
bare-suppression check in `base-quality-gates` had no exclusion list, so it
walked `.venv`: 3586 files, 467 suppressions, 80 of them bare, essentially
all third-party. Its sibling in `base-quality` had excluded those
directories all along. Scoped, this repository scans 10 files with one
suppression and none bare.

**And then the audit found the fourth instance of the pattern the runner
was built to end.** `base-quality` requires a `.gitattributes` and this
repository has none, which is why a wrap-up edit to `CLAUDE.md` could
convert the whole file to CRLF -- 451 lines rewritten for a 7-line change,
plus a stray doubled CR -- and pass review, CI, smoke, sync and the
redundancy audit. It was the only text blob in the repository with CRLF.
#1272 repaired the file; #1273 tracks the missing `.gitattributes`.

**The reason the runner missed it is the more interesting half.** It
extracts fenced blocks, and `base-quality` states the line-ending check
inline: "Verify with `git ls-files --eol` -- no committed file reports
`i/crlf`". That is a command and a pass condition, which is what the
pair-check rule asks for; it simply is not in a fence. So a green
conformance run -- 19 passed, 0 failed -- coexisted with a violated rule on
the same tree, which is the runner's own failure mode one level up. Filed
as #1274. Fencing that one check would fix the instance and leave the
class, so the issue asks which form a shipped check must take.

**What is left.** v2.64 is not cut: two issues remain open behind #1269,
which is a decision rather than work. #1262, on which audit pass owns the
journal entry when a session runs the checklist twice, was left out of
scope and is still open -- this session ran the audit once, so the question
did not arise.

## 2026-08-29 -- The rule it broke was one it ships

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**The session released the two pull requests held for review, cut v2.64.0,
and violated a rule the release itself carries.** #1269 and #1270 had been
open since the previous session, the first held deliberately because
`SECURITY.md` makes commitments on the maintainer's behalf. Three of those
were the maintainer's to make and all three were answered: enable GitHub
private vulnerability reporting, keep the 5-business-day acknowledgement
window, and settle `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` by discussion rather than by
default. Private reporting is now enabled, so the advisory link the file
names resolves instead of returning 404.

**Merging the base of a stack with a delete-branch flag closed the pull
request stacked on it.** #1270 targeted #1269's branch. `gh pr merge 1269
--squash --delete-branch` deleted that branch as a separate step from the
merge, and GitHub closed #1270 rather than retargeting it. Neither repair
was available on its own: reopening a pull request requires its base ref to
exist, and retargeting requires the pull request to be open. Recovery was to
recreate the base ref at a commit still reachable from the stacked branch,
reopen, retarget to `main`, then delete the ref again -- no force-push, no
lost review history, and the pull request kept its number and its ADR.

**`base-git` already forbids exactly this, in a section named `Merging a
stack`.** It states the rule -- MUST NOT pass a delete-branch flag while any
pull request still targets the branch -- and it states the recovery, which
matches step for step what was improvised. The template resolves into all 17
chains, this repository's own included. So the failure was not a missing
rule, and not a rule that had to be discovered by being broken: it was a
rule present, shipped, and unread at the moment it applied. Every earlier
instance this milestone found was an absence -- no `SECURITY.md`, no
`CHANGELOG.md`, no `.gitattributes`. This one is the inverse and it is worse,
because nothing about the repository's state was wrong.

**The check that exists for it cannot fail.** It runs `gh api
repos/<owner>/<repo> --jq '.delete_branch_on_merge'` and passes on "the
command prints the setting"; `true` and `false` both print, so no
configuration is a finding. The conformance runner skips it besides, its
disposition recorded as reported by the platform settings audit rather than
by a per-tree check. And the setting here is `true` -- which the rule
describes as the path that retargets the dependent pull request. That is
true of automatic deletion only: passing the flag explicitly still takes the
unsafe path, so a reader who runs the check, sees `true` and types the flag
anyway loses the pull request having followed the check. Filed as #1279, and
deliberately not fixed in isolation: it is the same question #1274 and #1260
ask about what a shipped check must assert, and answering it for one check
leaves the class.

**v2.64.0 is the first release this project cut with a changelog.** The
procedure's new step held: `Unreleased` was cut into `[2.64.0] - 2026-08-29`
in its own pull request, #1276, which merged before the tag so the tagged
tree names its own release. The changelog-completeness check reported 12
commits against 7 entries, and the gap is the point -- three of the twelve
touch a template and the other nine touch only this repository's own files,
which a consuming project never receives. The tag is annotated at the
changelog commit rather than at `main`, the release title is the bare
version, and the milestone closed at 7 of 7.

**`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` moved from SHOULD to MAY.** The rule had been a SHOULD,
which under this project's RFC 2119 table obliges every consuming project
that declines the file to record a justification -- for a document whose
absence degrades nothing operational, where a project without one still has
a disclosure route and a contribution path. Three options were weighed:
carry the file, record a deviation in an ADR, or change the keyword. The ADR
was the tempting one and the worst: it would have had this repository
decline a SHOULD on grounds any consumer could recite verbatim, demoting the
rule to MAY in practice while leaving it written as SHOULD. Changing the
keyword says the same thing honestly and costs one line. #1147 is discharged
with nothing recorded, because MAY leaves nothing to record.

**A milestone was created to keep the release gate honest, not to plan a
cut.** #1277 merged after the v2.64.0 tag, so it sat unreleased and
unmilestoned, which is precisely what the milestone-coverage check reports
at the next cut. `v2.65 -- The strength a rule claims and the work it
obliges` now carries it, and the check re-run against v2.65 is clean at one
pull request. The theme is provisional and was named from two issues rather
than from a groom; the groom still has to happen before the cut is scoped.

**What is left.** #1279 joins #1273 and #1274 as findings this repository
made about itself and has not yet fixed. #1262 -- which audit pass owns the
journal entry when a session runs the checklist twice -- did not arise
again: the release wrote no entry, the audit ran once afterwards, and this
entry is written last, after the items that filed #1279 and created the
milestone it names.

## 2026-08-29 -- The check that could not fail

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 [1M]).

**The session groomed the backlog, scoped v2.65 from the cluster the groom
found, shipped it, and cut the release.** Going in, `v2.65` existed as a
milestone holding one closed issue and one open one, themed from those two
rather than from a groom. The groom changed the theme. Three issues -- #1274,
#1279 and #1273 -- turned out to be the same finding from three directions,
and two of them said so in their own bodies: #1279 recorded that it "belongs
with #1274 rather than being fixed alone". The milestone was retitled to what
the groom actually produced, `A rule is worth what its check can establish`,
and #1277 fitted it in retrospect -- a SHOULD whose check could not tell a
recorded decision from neglect.

**Grooming moved a claim, which is the point of grooming.** #1274 was filed
as "the runner cannot see a check stated inline", naming one instance. A scan
for a verification phrase paired with a backticked command outside a fence
returned five candidates, of which three were not defects: two were
pass-condition prose sitting directly under a fence the runner already reads,
which is the intended form, and one was a table row auditing which release
steps carry a pass condition. The two real ones were *different shapes*.
`base-quality`'s line-ending rule stated a real command in prose.
`base-examples`' smoke-job rule stated `Check: install the project alone,
then execute every file under examples/` -- where the command is prose, so
there was nothing to move into a fence at all. That second shape is why
"fence that one check" could never have closed the class, and it is what the
issue as filed did not reach.

**Key changes.** `base-quality-gates` now states the form a shipped check
must take: the command sits in a fence, prose carries the pass condition
beside it, a sentence naming no command states no check, and a tool
reporting how many checks it ran must report how many it could not see. It
carries its own check for the last part. `base-git`'s delete-branch check
stopped printing a setting and started asserting one -- its old pass
condition was "the command prints the setting", which both values satisfy,
so no configuration was ever a finding. `base-git` also now says that the
setting licenses nothing: `true` describes what an automatic deletion does,
and passing the flag explicitly takes the manual path either way, which is
how #1270 was lost during the previous session.

**The repository stopped violating a fourth rule it ships.** `base-quality`
requires a `.gitattributes` and there was none, which is how a script
rewrote `CLAUDE.md` to CRLF in v2.64 -- 451 lines for a seven-line change,
past review, CI, smoke, sync and the redundancy audit. The file is committed
with `* text=auto eol=lf`; `git add --renormalize .` afterwards changed no
path but the new file itself. It earned its place within the hour: `sync.py`
wrote CRLF working copies on the very next branch and Git normalised them to
LF on `add`.

**CI caught the branch with the branch's own rule, and the fix was two
levels deep.** The `A change to an existing test is visible` check fired on
`M tests/conformance.py`. That is the check working -- the file was modified,
not added -- but its disposition *scored* it, while the rule it belongs to
says in its own text that it is "governance, not a new pass/fail metric".
Since `CLAUDE.md` 6.2 obliges a disposition edit for every new fenced block,
every conforming template change from then on would have failed it. Moving it
to the runner's `manual` disposition looked like the fix and was not: the
runner reported manual output nowhere, so the check would have run, seen the
modified file, and told nobody -- while its own docstring claimed the
operator reads that output. Both halves were fixed, and the reusable rule
behind them was filed as #1287, because it landed only in this repository's
runner.

**The release gate could not read three of its five commits.** The
milestone-coverage check resolves every `(#N)` in a commit subject as a pull
request. Three subjects carried issue numbers instead, because the merges
passed `gh pr merge --subject`, which replaces the title and suppresses the
number GitHub would otherwise append. `CLAUDE.md` puts the issue number in
the pull request title, so the intended subject carries both, and v2.64 has
one that does. Coverage was verified by hand -- it was complete -- and the
gate's defect filed as #1285. The check printed "pull requests merged since:
5" while reading two of them, which is the same shape as everything else
this cut is about.

**v2.65.0 shipped** with four issues closed, four content pull requests and
the changelog cut. The tag is annotated at the changelog commit, the title is
the bare version, the milestone closed at 4 of 4, and the tag guard passed.
Conformance went from 44 registered blocks to 47 and from 19 checks run to
22, because removing a placeholder from the delete-branch check let it run
here for the first time.

**ADR-031 records the decision rather than only the rule.** ADR-030 had
already decided that the runner reconciles the runnable subset against every
fenced block, because an extraction that under-counts looks identical to a
clean one -- but that reconciliation is bounded by the fence and cannot
report a check it has no way to count. The rejected alternative is the half
worth keeping: parsing inline prose is more faithful to what authors write,
and it trades a countable gap for an uncountable one.

**What is left.** #1285 and #1287 are this session's own findings about
itself, unfixed, joining a pattern now four cuts old. No cut is pre-scoped:
the groom consumed the cluster it found, and the next one starts from the
unmilestoned set again. #1262 -- which audit pass owns the entry when a
session runs the checklist twice -- did not arise: the release wrote no
entry, the audit ran once, and this entry is written last, after the items
that filed #1285, #1287 and ADR-031.

## 2026-08-30 — A rename measured before it was agreed to

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**No release was cut.** The session opened on a clean tree at v2.65.0 and
stayed there: four issues filed, one pull request merged, one issue from
the parallel session labelled. Everything below is tracker and audit work.

**The request was to file a ticket renaming `PLAYBOOK.md` to `RUNBOOK.md`,
and to say whether I agreed.** I did not, and the disagreement was worth
more than the ticket. All twenty sections of `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` are tasks a
contributor chooses to perform; a runbook is what an operator reaches for
when a running system misbehaves, and this project has no running system.
Exactly one section, "Release a new version", is runbook-shaped -- and the
tracker already calls it that, in #1228 and #1237, while the file
containing it does not. So the friction was real and the proposed fix was
aimed one level too high.

**Two objections to the same filename were open at once.** #714 has asked
since July whether the guide docs should drop SHOUT-case. Answering the
noun now and the casing later renames the same file twice in every
consuming project, so #1291 folds both into one spike and #714 is left open
pending a deliberate close as its duplicate.

**The cost is downstream, and nobody had measured it.** `base/core/docs.md`
resolves into 17 of 17 chains, so its document table is inherited by every
generated project. A survey across both accounts found 14 repositories
carrying `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` -- this one and 13 consumers -- 13 carrying
`ONBOARDING.md`, and only this one carrying `docs/SPEC.md`. Measured on the
two local clones, a consumer holds around 50 references across 5 or 6
files, so roughly three quarters of the rename lands outside this
repository, in trees `tools/sync.py` never touches. #1292 carries that
rollout as a checklist, and pushes one question back into #1291 that it did
not originally ask: whether existing projects migrate at all, or only newly
generated ones take the new name. Those two answers differ by about 650
edits.

**The first survey was wrong and looked right.** Probing each repository
with `gh api repos/<r>/contents/<path> --jq '.name' 2>/dev/null` reported a
hit on all sixteen, including repositories with no `docs/` directory. `gh
api` prints the 404 body to stdout, where `2>/dev/null` cannot reach it,
and the jq read of that error object is a non-empty string. Nothing in the
output looked wrong -- a uniform positive is the only symptom. CLAUDE.md
6.2 already told the agent to check the working directory on an unexpected
negative; #1294 adds the inverse, which is to validate a uniform result
against a control that must fail. #1296 proposes the reusable half beside
`ai-workflow-pwd-on-negative`, the sibling rule it belongs with.

**The new rule earned its keep within the hour.** Measuring where that
upstream rule should go produced a reach of 0 of 17 chains for
`ai-workflow.md`, which reads like an orphaned template. It is not:
SPEC.md's "Orthogonal templates" names `ai-workflow` explicitly as opt-in
and excluded from reachability checks. Seven other files score zero for the
same documented reason. That was checked before it was reported, which is
the whole content of the rule.

**What is left.** #1290 arrived from the parallel session unlabelled and
was labelled `task` + `P2` on the way past; #1293 arrived from the same
place already labelled, and needed nothing. It makes five issues -- #1267,
#1285, #1287, #1288, #1290 -- all saying that a check reports something
other than what it establishes, which is a stronger cut theme than anything
else in the backlog and still unscoped. #1295 records that the PLAYBOOK has
no procedure for measuring downstream reach before a required document
changes; it was filed rather than written, because the procedure is only
needed if #1291 decides to rename. Backlog closed at 59 open issues, label
conformance empty, smoke 26 of 26, sync clean, conformance 22 of 22.

## 2026-08-31 — The check that reported and was not read

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**v2.66.0 shipped: seven issues, eight pull requests, one theme.** The
previous session ended by naming five issues that all said a check reports
something other than what it establishes, called it a stronger cut theme
than anything else in the backlog, and left it unscoped. This session
scoped it, and the groom added two more issues before the first line of
code was written.

**Verifying the claims before grooming changed one of them.** #1287 was
filed as two halves; measuring found the first half already shipped in
#1274, so only the upstream rule remained. The placement question its
acceptance criteria demanded was answered by measurement rather than by
adjacency: `quality-gates.md` reaches 12 of 17 chains and `quality.md`
reaches 17, and naming the sibling rules from the wider file would dangle
in the 5 chains that carry one without the other. So the rule states its
substance inline in `quality.md` and names no section. All 17 generated
chains changed, which is that measurement showing up in the diff.

**The rule's own acceptance criterion was the one thing not delivered.**
It asked the rule to name its check in the form ADR-031 requires. Every
mechanical form needs to know how one project's runner classifies a check
or where it writes its record, and reports here are gitignored, so a
report-keyed check has nothing to read in CI. That is the brittle check
`base-quality-gates` tells an author not to invent. The rule ships
declarative and says so in its last bullet.

**A green run had been hiding a finding for two sessions.** The
conformance runner recorded every judgement check as `PASS`, because the
manual disposition never sets a failure. So a run printing four over-limit
changelog entries and a drifted identifier convention also printed
`22 passed  0 failed`, and nobody read past the total. The runner now has
a fourth result: `REVIEW` is counted on its own line, does not fail the
run, and a judgement check that prints nothing fails outright. The same
run now reads `10 passed  0 failed  0 errors  12 awaiting a reading`.

**The report header had never added up.** `write_report` counted four
statuses and dropped anything else, so it announced `47 tests` and then
listed 35. It now counts unknown statuses by name. Twelve of forty-seven
results had been in no bucket at all.

**The four over-limit entries were in the section cut the week the bound
shipped**, and each ended the way the rule predicts: a sentence of
reasoning appended to a sentence that already said what changed. Trimming
them lost nothing, because the reasoning was already in ADR-031 and in
the two 2026-08-29 journal entries. A published changelog section is
editable in a way a journal entry is not -- `base-docs` fixes the journal
once written and says of the changelog only that it records a release for
a reader outside the project.

**The first fix for the width exemption was wrong and a control caught
it.** The obvious mechanical form -- delete the unbreakable tokens, see
whether the rest fits -- excuses every long line that happens to carry a
link, because deleting the link makes the remainder fit. A control line of
ordinary prose with a short link went unreported. The shipped test
measures the token instead: a line is exempt where an unbreakable token
plus its indentation cannot fit at all. Five controls now pin it in both
directions, and the corpus stayed at 203 files, so the exemption narrowed
the findings rather than the input.

**The exemption also moved from configured to structural.** `base-docs`
had listed unbreakable link targets among the exemptions that travel with
the linter's declaration. No Markdown linter expresses that one, so the
rule was granting an excuse no configuration could carry -- which is how a
rule and its check disagree while both look right.

**The release gate was fixed and then used on this release.** Cutting
v2.65.0 it had reported that three of five references could not be read;
all three were issue numbers, because the title convention puts the issue
at the end and a squash appends the pull request number only when the
subject is left alone. It now resolves each reference through the issues
endpoint, which answers for either kind and says which, and asks the exit
status rather than whether output arrived -- `gh api` prints its error
body to stdout, the trap #1296 is about. Run against v2.65.0..HEAD it read
18 references, 11 pull requests and 7 issues, and reported nothing. A
control set to a milestone that does not exist reported every issue and
what it actually carries, so the clean result is the check agreeing rather
than the check reaching nothing.

**`--subject` was the cause, and now two documents say so.** `base-git`
gains a MUST NOT under squash-merge safety and the PLAYBOOK says it at the
step where the merge happens. The default subject is the form the
convention wants.

**Reading the twelve judgement checks is now part of the wrap-up, and it
filed four issues.** #1309 is the sharpest: a check in
`quality-gates.md` reports a bare `0`, stating neither its corpus nor its
finding -- the rule this very release shipped, violated one file over.
#1310 has the register-identifier check calling an unadopted convention a
drifted one. #1311 has the continuation-safety check flagging valid shell
inside a documented YAML workflow. #1312 asks what a release-time or
migration-time check should print when run at neither moment, since both
currently emit a count whose pass condition assumes the moment is in
progress.

**What is left.** The four above are unmilestoned and unscoped; three of
them are the same shape as the cut that just shipped, which suggests the
theme is not finished. #1267 and #1293 remain the strongest content
cluster for a next cut, with #1033 -- all three about a rule recommending
a shape that is wrong for the case the caller has. #1291's rename decision
still gates #1292 and #1295. Backlog closed at 59 open issues, label
conformance empty, smoke 26 of 26, sync clean, conformance 10 passed with
12 awaiting a reading and all twelve read.

## 2026-08-31 — The finding a reader learns to dismiss

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**v2.67.0 shipped: five issues, six pull requests, one theme.** All five
came out of the twelve judgement readings the previous session produced
and could not act on. Each check executed cleanly and told a reader
nothing they could act on: a bare count naming neither its corpus nor its
finding, two standing findings that were simply false, a verdict-shaped
line printed at a moment when its pass condition could not hold, and a
gap letting a dated record cite a command its own commit falsifies.

**Verifying the claims before grooming changed two of the five.** #1312
was filed against `commits carried: 0`, observed minutes after the
v2.66.0 tag. Re-measured five days later the same check read `1`, then
`2` once the first pull request merged. Nothing had been fixed — the zero
holds only in the window between a tag and the next merge. Had the fix
keyed on the empty count, it would have reported inapplicable inside that
window and gone back to printing an unreadable verdict outside it. The
shipped detector asks the question that actually identifies the moment:
is the tag already at HEAD. #1309's sweep went the other way and got
smaller — reading all twelve put three checks in the defective shape
rather than the eleven the issue estimated, and two more state their
corpus and make silence the finding by their own pass conditions, so they
were left alone and the decision recorded on the issue.

**One of the five was filed against a check that does not exist.** The
disposition for `git.md:951` was titled "Security controls survive a
migration", which is the neighbouring entry's subject; the block it
selects is the off-limits-path check. That wrong title is what put
"migration" in #1312's text. The complaint survived — the block is
moment-specific either way — but the criterion had to be restated before
it could be discharged. A registry that names a block wrongly is worse
than one that omits it, because the omission is what `run_conformance.py`
already refuses to run past.

**The off-limits fix nearly swallowed the signal it was meant to
sharpen.** The first cut reported inapplicable whenever HEAD was at the
base, which is also what running the check before committing looks like —
the failure its pass condition exists to warn about, and the natural
mistake, since the moment to run a pre-pull-request check is while
writing it. It now asks whether the tree is dirty and separates three
states that were one count: uncommitted work, named in those words; no
branch open, which does not apply; and a real branch, unchanged.

**Every fix was control-tested, and one control paid for all of them.**
The register check was driven through four fixtures — no chapter and no
ids, a chapter with no ids, a chapter with ids, and an id outside any
chapter — because a check that stops reporting drift is indistinguishable
from one that never could. The continuation check was driven through a
fixture carrying the same continuation twice, once in a `bash` block and
once in `yaml`; the bash line is reported, the yaml line is not, and both
corpus counts moved, so the fixture was read rather than skipped. Its
narrowed corpus landed on 48, which is exactly the runnable count
`run_conformance.py` computes independently and without being wired to
it.

**The release-ordering guard was verified against the live case it was
filed for.** After the tag was pushed the check reads `HEAD is v2.67.0;
no release is in preparation, so this check does not apply`, where five
days earlier it printed the failure-shaped zero that prompted the issue.

**Six over-limit changelog entries survived five pull requests, and the
run reported them every time.** Each entry ran between 73 and 97 words
against a declared bound of 40. Every pull request ran the conformance
suite; every run printed `0 failed` and `12 awaiting a reading`, and the
summary line was what got read. They were caught at the changelog cut,
by working through the pile by hand, and trimmed in #1320. The previous
session's entry describes the same failure with four entries, so this is
the second occurrence and the first where a fix was available: the check
declares a limit and counts against it, which is an automatic verdict
being reported as a judgement. #1322 asks which side each threshold check
belongs on, and notes the trade-off that kept three of them manual in
#1309 — the runner carries output only for a manual disposition, so
reaching a verdict currently costs the reading.

**The rule shipped and two of its own siblings still violate it.** Both
were read during the work, in files being edited for the rule, and
neither was noticed: the changelog-completeness check prints two zeros
after a release, and the test-visibility check prints three on `main`.
#1321 carries them, and asks for the sweep rather than the two instances
— a new rule applied to the cases that prompted it, rather than to its
own reach, is the same containment failure one level up.

**One gap shipped declaratively on purpose.** #1314's rule about a dated
report citing a moving reference is mechanically checkable only if you
can identify a dated report, which you cannot; a locator for commands
naming `HEAD` would report every runbook that correctly tells a reader to
run one against their own tree. Manufacturing a standing finding in the
release that exists to remove them would have been a poor trade, and the
rule says so in its own text rather than leaving it implied. The same
constraint kept `quality-gates-check-timing` unnamed in the prose:
`base-docs` reaches 17 chains of 17 and `base-quality-gates` reaches 12,
so the substance is stated inline.

**PRs merged:** #1315, #1316, #1317, #1318, #1319, #1320

**Issues closed:** #1309, #1310, #1311, #1312, #1314

**Issues opened:** #1321, #1322

**What is left.** #1321 and #1322 are unmilestoned and both are about
this release's own work. The strongest content cluster remains #1267,
#1293 and #1033 — a rule recommending a shape that is wrong for the case
the caller has — and all three were verified against the tree during this
groom, so the next cut is scoped one release ahead as v2.63 showed to be
worth doing. #1291's rename decision still gates #1292 and #1295.
Backlog closed at 57 open issues, label conformance empty, smoke 26 of
26, sync clean, conformance 10 passed with 12 awaiting a reading and all
twelve read.

## 2026-08-31 — The right diagnosis and the wrong remedy

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**v2.68.0 shipped: four issues, five pull requests, one theme.** Three
rules named a real defect and prescribed a shape wrong for one class of
caller, and the fourth was this repository's own debt from the release
before. The cut was scoped from a groom done during v2.67.0 and shipped
unchanged, which is the second time planning one release ahead has paid
and the first time it has done so twice running.

**The flag rule was right about the flag and wrong about the
replacement.** "No boolean flag parameters — use an enum or two named
functions instead" fits a flag selecting what the code does. It fails a
flag selecting how many rules to apply, and a caller following it lands
on a validation mode: `STRICT`, `PERMISSIVE`, `RAW`. That satisfies the
letter and fails twice. `PERMISSIVE` names no set, so nothing can be
asserted against it. And a test wanting to say "this breaks the count
limit, so the device must reject it with this error" needs the name of
the limit, which a setting cannot carry. The names were what the caller
needed and the enum is where they went to be lost. The shape that works
returns the findings, each naming its rule, with a guard raising when the
list is not empty — one line over the first, so a caller who only wants
to be stopped is not made to handle a list.

**The variadic rule ships a tell rather than a principle.** An abstract
base declaring `serialize(self, **kwargs)` type-checks against every
subclass and constrains none, and nothing reports it: a linter has no
rule for it, review reads one class at a time and each reads fine alone,
and the tests pass because they instantiate concrete classes. In the
project that prompted it the divergence went unseen until a type checker
was wired years later and reported 122 in a single module. The templates
already named Liskov once, in a testing principles list; what they lacked
was the tell and the named resolution for the legitimate case, where a
mid-hierarchy class offers a capability its subtypes must not — that
capability gets its own name and stops being an override.

**A guard that works and a guard that is used look identical from a
suite.** One library shipped both a lock and a stop event inert across two
public classes, with a test module written specifically about those
locks. Four tests asserted each component holds a working lock, that the
two are not shared, and that both are the same type. All four passed
against a sender that never acquired its lock. The new rule asks for the
taking — a recording wrapper around the real guard, driven by the code
under test, asserted on the order — and pairs it with a control, since "a
stopped component does no work" passes trivially against a component that
never does anything.

**Its sibling sweep shipped as a fenced check rather than a sentence.**
The issue described it as a grep, which under ADR-031 states no check at
all. It is now a block with a pass condition: at least two references to
the field, and a consumer among them, because one reference is the
assignment that creates the guard. Dispositioned as skipped here, since
it takes the module and the field as arguments.

**The moment rule shipped last release with two of its own siblings
violating it, and the sweep was the deliverable rather than the two
fixes.** All 22 executing checks were measured. Two were moment-specific
and unhandled — changelog completeness and test visibility, both in files
edited for that rule, both read during that work, neither noticed. Two
were fixed in v2.67.0, one already reported inapplicability, sixteen
answer a property of the tree and one a property of the repository. Each
fix reuses the detector its own neighbour already had rather than
inventing one, and the test-visibility check inherited the
uncommitted-work fork too: the natural moment to run a check about a
change under review is while writing that change, and collapsing that to
"does not apply" would swallow the case the reader most needs told.

**The changelog word bound needed no trimming at the cut, and that is a
practice rather than a fix.** Last release six entries shipped between 73
and 97 words against a bound of 40 and were caught by hand at the cut.
This time the bound was checked in each pull request as the entry was
written; two were over on their first draft, at 49 and 43 words, and were
trimmed before pushing. The mechanism is still owed — #1322 asks whether
a check declaring a limit and counting against it belongs in the
judgement pile at all.

**Five of the twelve readings now say "does not apply", and the runner
counts them as work.** That is the moment rule's own consequence landing
in the pile it was meant to shrink: the summary asks for twelve readings
where seven are outstanding. `SKIP` cannot absorb them — it is decided in
advance, in the dispositions file, about this repository, while these are
decided at run time by the check about this moment, and next week the same
check applies. #1329 asks for the sixth result and, more usefully, for the
signal a check uses to declare it, since matching the phrase "does not
apply" in output would be a check reading prose.

**PRs merged:** #1324, #1325, #1326, #1327, #1328

**Issues closed:** #1293, #1033, #1267, #1321

**Issues opened:** #1329

**What is left.** #1322 and #1329 are both about the runner's vocabulary
for a result, and they compose: one asks which checks should stop being
judgements because they have a threshold, the other asks how a judgement
check says it has nothing to judge. Together they are the strongest
candidate for the next cut, and neither is groomed yet. #1291's rename
decision still gates #1292 and #1295, and remains the user's to make.
Backlog closed at 54 open issues, label conformance empty, smoke 26 of 26,
sync clean, conformance 10 passed with 12 awaiting a reading and all
twelve read.

## 2026-08-31 — The wrap-up audit that followed the cut

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**This is the session's second entry, and #1262 is the reason.** The
v2.68.0 release wrap-up wrote one, naming the issue it had just filed. The
explicit end-of-session audit then filed another issue, labelled two more,
and merged a pull request, none of which the first entry can name. Editing
it in place would change what a written record claims, which `base-docs`
routes through a new record instead. The open issue asks whether the
release wrap-up should write an entry at all; until it is answered the
cost is this — a second entry, for the same session, on the same day.

**Two duties went into CLAUDE.md and one was the wrong shape first.** The
changelog entry is now kept within the forty-word bound in the pull
request that writes it rather than at the cut. The second — that a
conformance run is not clean until its judgement readings are read — was
drafted as four lines restating the reasoning, and the PLAYBOOK's "Run the
test suite" already carries that reasoning. CLAUDE.md forbids duplicating
content across documents, so it ships as one line and a pointer. Both
rules exist because both were failed this session.

**The PLAYBOOK gained the control-testing procedure, which had been used
four times and written down nowhere.** The part worth documenting is not
the idea but the obstruction: where the fixture must live under
`templates/`, `run_conformance.py` refuses to execute at all, because an
unregistered fenced block in the fixture is a missing disposition and the
registry reconciliation runs before any check does. The section carries
the direct-extraction form that gets past it, the pass condition that
makes a control worth running, and the placeholder trap — `MILESTONE =
None` rather than an empty string cost a first attempt.

**CI failed on that pull request for a reason that was not that pull
request.** The label-conformance check went red because two issues had
arrived unlabelled from a parallel session between the release and the
audit. That is the gate working: nothing else surfaces an unlabelled issue,
and it surfaced this one against an unrelated branch within minutes.
#1331 and #1332 are labelled `task` / `P2`, each with the precedent
recorded on the issue, and they are a pair — same provenance, and #1332's
worked example is the loosening #1331 argues for, so implementing either
alone leaves the other half-told.

**The session's one unhomed pattern is filed rather than shipped.** Four
checks were control-tested across the two releases, and the practice that
made those controls worth anything was requiring the check's own corpus
count to MOVE between the runs: a fixture the check never reached produces
exactly the result a correctly-silent check produces. The mechanics are
project-specific and went to the PLAYBOOK; the rule is not, and has no
upstream home, so #1334 carries it to `base-testing`.

**PRs merged:** #1333

**Issues opened:** #1334

**Issues labelled:** #1331, #1332 — arrived unlabelled from a parallel
session

**What is left.** Three unmilestoned issues now cluster around the
runner's vocabulary for a result — #1322 on which checks should stop being
judgements, #1329 on how a judgement check says it has nothing to judge,
and #1334 on what makes a control credible. #1331 and #1332 are a separate
pair, both from `pyomb`, about a gate whose comparison makes a legitimate
state unreachable and about what a loosened gate leaves behind. Neither
cluster is groomed. Backlog closed at 57 open issues, label conformance
empty, smoke 26 of 26, sync clean, conformance 10 passed with 12 awaiting
a reading and all twelve read.

## 2026-09-01 — The contract is in the pass condition, not the output

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**The groom ran first and the theme fell out of it.** Forty-three
unmilestoned issues re-read, each candidate's claims measured against the
tree before clustering rather than after. Three clustered on two files and
became `v2.69 — The reading the check has already done`; two more, both
from `pyomb`, became `v2.70 — The gate that was loosened on purpose`. The
merged-commit sweep found one hit across 754 commit subjects: an upstream
flag whose ordering half was closed by a pull request years of releases
ago and whose heading half is untouched, so it is recorded as staying open
rather than closed.

**Verifying the claims changed the plan twice, and the second correction
undid the first.** The issue proposing that a check with a declared
threshold should reach a verdict named one such check; reading the twelve
judgement checks' readings found five. Reading their stated pass
conditions found four — the continuation locator prints three counts
ending in a zero, the exact shape of a predicate, and its pass condition
says a non-zero count is not a failure. Then a fifth was claimed for the
neighbouring issue on the grounds that its own pass condition is
mechanical, which was wrong for a different reason: the reason it stays a
judgement was recorded beside its disposition, and scoring it would fail
every conforming change, because every template change owes an edit to the
file the check inspects.

**That is the session's one general finding and it is filed, not
shipped.** A check's output is one sample of its contract taken on a clean
tree, and it misleads in both directions — a violation count reading zero
looks like a rule requiring zero, and a count the rule tolerates reads as
one it forbids. Only the stated pass condition separates "MUST be zero"
from "is the set to read". The one check carrying a recorded reason is the
one nearly converted wrongly, which is the case for requiring that reason
made rather than argued.

**The reading pile fell from twelve to four, and four of the eight that
left had already answered.** The first change gave four checks predicates
and required every remaining judgement to state what about it takes a
person. The second reserved exit status 3 for a check reporting at run
time that its moment is not in progress, counted apart from the readings.
The design was the user's call between three candidates; a first-line
marker was rejected as a string convention no check declares, and both
signals together as two conventions that can drift apart. ADR-032 carries
the alternatives, which had otherwise lived only in a pull request body.

**Every exit-3 path was driven to fire before being believed.** Two by
tagging HEAD and deleting the tag, two by extracting the block with its
base replaced, two because they fire on this repository as it stands — and
the run's own not-applicable count moved from zero to two to four, which
is what separates a path that was never reached from one that correctly
stayed quiet. The negative control matters as much: with a dirty tree both
base-gated checks still exit clean and say `commit it and run again`,
because the operator has something to do there and a status meaning no
reader is needed would be wrong. That practice, used four times across two
releases and written down only in this repository's PLAYBOOK, is now
upstream as `testing-control-corpus-moves`.

**The audit caught a milestone that existed and held nothing.** `v2.70`
was created with a description enumerating two issues and no issues
assigned, and it stayed that way for the length of the session. Creating a
milestone and assigning its issues are two calls; every view that shows a
milestone shows its title, and the release gate reads the issues a
milestone holds, so an empty one passes the gate rather than failing it.
The groom procedure now has a fifth step that assigns and reads the count
back.

**PRs merged:** #1336, #1338, #1339, #1340, #1341

**Issues closed:** #1322, #1329, #1334

**Issues opened:** #1342

**ADRs:** ADR-032

**What is left.** `v2.69` is complete at three closed and nothing open,
and it is NOT tagged — the session was asked to wrap up rather than cut,
so the release, its tag message quoting the milestone theme, and the
GitHub Release are all owed. `v2.70` is scoped and assigned. One issue arrived
from a parallel session mid-cut, already labelled, on whether a periodic
review attached to every release decays into paperwork — unmilestoned and
unread here. Backlog
closed at 56 open issues, label conformance empty, smoke 26 of 26, sync
clean, conformance 14 passed with 4 not applicable and 4 awaiting a
reading, all four read: release ordering carries five commits with nothing
ready and unmerged, the Unreleased section holds three entries against
five commits where the three journal and documentation commits are
deliberately not notable, the continuation locator finds none, and one
workflow run is recorded against the head commit.

## 2026-09-01 — The release quiets the check that verifies it

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**The cut was owed rather than planned.** `v2.69` closed three issues and
merged five pull requests in the previous session, which was asked to wrap
up rather than release, so the milestone stood complete and untagged
overnight. This session opened on a status reading that found it, and the
cut then ran the nine PLAYBOOK steps against a tree whose content had all
merged a day earlier.

**Three gates ran before the changelog was touched.** Milestone-coverage
with `MILESTONE` set found twelve references since `v2.68.0`, resolving to
nine pull requests and three issues, and printed nothing after them.
Release-ordering listed nine carried commits and no open pull request ready
but unmerged. Changelog-completeness read nine commits against four
entries, and the reconciliation is the part no gate performs: three journal
entries, two process-document changes and one decision record carry no
entry deliberately, and the three template commits account for all four.
Each entry was measured against the forty-word bound in the cut itself
rather than taken from a summary — 37, 32, 35 and 33.

**The release changed how its own verification reads.** Before the tag the
conformance run reported four checks not applicable and four awaiting a
reading; after it, six and two. Release-ordering and changelog-completeness
both answer `HEAD is v2.69.0; no release is in preparation` and exit 3.
That status is what #1329 shipped in this release, so the first thing the
cut did was drive the path it had just published, on the live case rather
than a fixture. The count moving from four to six is the only thing
separating that from two checks that quietly stopped running, which is the
claim #1334 made and this release also carries.

**The audit found a rule this repository learned and never shipped.** #1196
settled the release title as the bare version, because the annotated tag
message and the milestone description already carry the theme and a release
list mixing the two forms reads as two conventions rather than one. It
fixed `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` and stopped there. `base/core/git.md` still hands
every consumer `gh release create --title "vX.Y.Z — <milestone name>"`, so
a template reaching seventeen chains tells them to do what the project
owning the rule decided against. `v2.64` was about this repository
violating rules it ships; this is the inverse, a rule it derived and kept
to itself. Filed as #1346.

**The runbook denies a step it requires.** The release preamble says there
is no branch, commit or pull request; step 4 says the changelog cut is its
own pull request and MUST merge before the tag. This cut created all three
— branch, commit `da84ea1`, pull request #1344. The preamble means no
version-bump commit and predates ADR-029, and an operator who reads it and
tags `main` publishes a tree whose changelog still says `Unreleased`, with
nothing left to catch it: the completeness check exits 3 as not applicable
the moment the tag lands. Filed as #1345.

**PRs merged:** #1344

**Issues closed:** none — `v2.69`'s three closed in the previous session

**Issues opened:** #1345, #1346

**Released:** `v2.69.0`, tagged at `da84ea1` with the milestone theme in the
tag message, published with a bare-version title, milestone closed,
tag-guard green

**What is left.** `v2.70 — The gate that was loosened on purpose` is scoped
and assigned at two open issues, #1331 and #1332, to land as one pull
request because #1332's worked example is the loosening #1331 argues for.
#1342 and the two filed here are unmilestoned. The backlog closed at 58
open with 42 unmilestoned, label conformance empty, smoke 26 of 26, sync
clean, conformance 14 passed with six not applicable and two read: the
continuation scan finds no check split across a line, and the release
commit carries two workflow runs rather than none.

## 2026-09-01 — Every defect the cut met was already in the backlog

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**The scope was groomed a session ahead and shipped unchanged.** `v2.70`
was scoped at the previous wrap-up as #1331 and #1332, to land as one pull
request because #1332's worked example *is* the loosening #1331 argues for.
This session opened on a status reading, found the milestone assigned and
the tree clean, and built exactly that. It is the third cut running planned
one release ahead, and the third to need no rescoping on contact.

**Placement was measured before it was argued.** `git.md` resolves into
seventeen chains of seventeen and `quality-gates.md` into twelve, so #1331
went to the wider file per ADR-028. #1332 had no such choice: its anchor is
the rule on weakening a specification, which exists only in
`quality-gates.md`. That makes the pair straddle a containment boundary —
`quality-gates.md` may name `git.md`, and the reverse dangles five chains —
so the obligation #1332 adds is stated inline in `git.md` rather than by
naming its section, which SYS-11 would have caught either way.

**One of the two rules ships with no check, deliberately.** #1331
constrains how a project writes a currency gate, not any artifact sitting
in a tree, so there is nothing for a command to measure and
`quality-gates-pair-check` scopes its requirement to output constraints.
The temptation was to invent one to look thorough, which that rule names as
the wrong move.

**The other rule extended a check without touching its pass condition.**
`quality-gates-test-edit-boundary` gained the test root's added and removed
line counts. A deliberate loosening already fails its threshold by design;
the new counts are for the person that failure summons, and answer whether
the admitted case was asserted. Controls ran per
`testing-control-corpus-moves`: this branch reported zeros, `d036d56`
twenty-seven added against nine removed, `e97851b` one against four. The
corpus moved off zero and the signal pointed both ways, which is what
separates a working check from one that can no longer report.

**Three defects got in the way of the cut, and all three were already
filed.** The changelog-completeness check was deliberately not re-run after
the cut, because its reading would have been two commits against zero
entries — a failure by its pass condition and the false positive #1348
describes. The runbook's preamble again denied the pull request its own
step 4 requires, so step 4 was followed and #1345 stands. And `git.md`
still hands consumers the themed release title #1196 settled against, so
the bare title the PLAYBOOK specifies was used and #1346 stands. None was
in scope; none was fixed. The backlog had predicted the whole session.

**The release commit went red, and the check that exists for it caught
it.** Smoke failed on `f003ac1` after `curl` took a connection reset
pulling the gitleaks tarball, so the install step died before any check
ran. `platform/github.md`'s workflow-run reading is what surfaced it — a
commit inspected only for "not pending" would have read as fine, which is
the failure that check was written against. Re-run green; nothing in the
content was wrong.

**PRs merged:** #1349, #1350

**Issues closed:** #1331, #1332

**Issues opened:** #1351

**Released:** `v2.70.0`, tagged annotated at `f003ac1` — the changelog cut,
not `main`'s tip — with the milestone theme in the tag message, published
with a bare-version title, milestone closed, tag-guard green, and step 9
verified

**What is left.** No cut is scoped. The five unmilestoned release-procedure
issues cluster tightly enough to be one — #1348, #1345 and #1346 were all
met in this session's own cut, #1342 asks how a check's disposition is set,
and #1337 asks what a periodic review attached to every release decays
into. #1351 was filed at the wrap-up from the check built here: a check may
carry a verdict and a reading at once, addressed to different readers, and
nothing upstream says so. The backlog closed at 58 open with 44
unmilestoned, label conformance empty, smoke 26 of 26, sync clean,
conformance 14 passed with six not applicable and two read — the
continuation scan finds no check split across a line, and the release
commit's two workflow runs report no failure now that the flake is cleared.
## 2026-09-01 — The cut could not ship until it audited itself

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**The scope was groomed from the whole unmilestoned set, not from the
obvious cluster.** A status reading found `v2.70.0` shipped and the tree
clean, with six issues that memory already grouped as one theme. Grooming
all forty-four unmilestoned issues first per the PLAYBOOK procedure changed
two things about that group. Reading each claim against the tree showed
#1346 was worse than filed — the *manifest* release variant already used a
bare version in both artifacts, so the template shipped two variants
disagreeing with each other. And measuring reach put #1351 in the opposite
file from the one it nominated: `quality-gates.md` reaches twelve chains
and `quality.md` seventeen, so ADR-028 sends the rule to `base-quality`
and leaves `quality-gates` to defer. Grooming produced annotations and a
milestone, not edits, which is what the procedure asks for.

**Five pull requests closed the milestone.** #1354 made the
changelog-completeness check take its moment as a declared value instead of
detecting it from the tag, and removed the clause contradicting the
sentence two lines above it. #1355 gave the release theme to the annotated
tag message and the bare version to the title. #1356 narrowed the
pre-release periodic review to minor and major releases, with ADR-033.
#1357 stopped the runbook preamble denying the pull request its own step 4
requires. #1358 paired #1342 and #1351 in the file the measurement chose.

**The gate shipped in this release blocked its own cut.** ADR-033 says a
minor release owes a current periodic review; `v2.71.0` is minor, and the
newest record was dated 2026-06-26 against a `v2.70.0` released the same
morning. The check returned exit 1 on the release it was written for. Every
release from v2.64 on was minor, so the arrears predated the change — the
gate was simply the first thing to make them visible, which ADR-033's
Consequences section had recorded in advance.

**So the audit ran, and it found three defects in the same day's work.**
The periodic-review check *failed open* where no previous tag exists:
`git describe` prints nothing, every date sorts above the empty string, and
a first release — precisely one that owes the review — passed on a
1999 record at exit 0. The template had applied its own refuse-rather-than-
skip reasoning to an unreadable version and not to an unreadable tag.
`git.md` still read "Four of the eight carry no pass condition" after step 3
gained a check, because that line sat in the diff as *context* and was left
behind. And the runbook carried no step for the check at all. All three
landed in #1359. Inserting a step would have renumbered nine and staled
ADR-029's reference, so the runbook defers to `base-git`'s pre-release
sequence instead — the opposite of the duplication that produced the drift.

**A green check was mistaken for evidence, and the audit caught that too.**
#1358's description claimed SYS-11 confirmed its cross-file reference safe
in every chain. SYS-11 matches identifiers prefixed with a layer name, so
it can see 124 of the 366 declared section IDs and not one `quality-*`
among them — the pass was vacuous. The reference is safe, by containment,
because `quality.md` is core tier; that was established by an independent
reach measurement rather than by the check. Two live violations sit in the
same blind spot and ship in three `generated/` files today. Filed as #1361
and #1362, and recorded in the audit's method note rather than quietly
corrected.

**Two reviewers disagreed and averaging would have been wrong.** Value read
the changelog's "64 published versions from `v2.1.0` to `v2.63.0`" as off by
two; Documentation read it as reconciling exactly. Measuring the range the
sentence actually names — 63 tags, 62 published releases, `v2.57.0`
unpublished — showed Value right and Documentation counting from `v1.0.0`.
The report carries the measurement rather than either reviewer's number.

**Grades: overall C, set by Discovery as the lowest dimension.**
Architecture rose from C+ to B and Authoring from B+ to A-, while Value,
Testing and Documentation each slipped a half grade on ground newly
measured. June's bottleneck is genuinely gone and was proved so rather than
taken on faith — an independent PyYAML resolver byte-matched all seventeen
shipped chains. Discovery fell for standing still: its three High findings
are June's, untouched after ten weeks, all parked in the most distant
milestone.

**Nineteen issues filed, two at P1.** #1360, because the README's model
limitations table understates every chain by 1.5 to 8x and tells library
adopters a 32K context window suffices when the smallest such chain is
about 67K tokens. #1361, the SYS-11 pattern gap. The remainder run from a
second manifest parser in `sync.py` that still drops every block-list
dependency, through a SPEC resolution algorithm matching neither the
resolver nor the artifact, to three repository settings that contradict the
documents describing them.

**PRs merged:** #1354, #1355, #1356, #1357, #1358, #1359, #1379, #1380.
**Issues closed:** #1348, #1346, #1345, #1337, #1342, #1351 — milestone
`v2.71 — Where a procedure and its checks disagree with themselves`, 6 of 6.
**Issues opened:** #1360 through #1378 from the audit, and #1381 at the
wrap-up for the reusable form of the fail-open defect.
**Released:** `v2.71.0`, tagged annotated on the changelog cut `7bd0837`.
**State at close:** 73 tags all annotated, smoke 26/26, sync clean,
conformance 14 passed and 0 failed with both readings read, 0 open pull
requests, no stale branches, label conformance `[]`, 73 open issues.

## 2026-09-01 — The check that could not see, and the suite that did not count

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** Groomed the backlog and scoped `v2.72 — A pass that counted
no input, and a number that measured no chain` (milestone #78, six issues,
both open P1s). Shipped the first half: SYS-11 now decides what counts as a
prose reference from the IDs the tree declares rather than a list of layer
prefixes, `base-typescript` states two rules inline that it had been naming
across a chain gap, and all 26 smoke checks report what they inspected with
an empty corpus failing rather than passing.

**The groom corrected the issue it was grooming.** #1361 reported 366
declared IDs with 124 matchable. Measured with the check's own declaration
scanner — which requires the directive to own its line — the tree holds 341
declared IDs and the old pattern matched 100. The looser regex behind the
issue's number also counts `[ID: x]` inside a fenced code block in
`base-docs`, a docstring in an example function. Same conclusion, 241
invisible either way, but the numbers the check acts on are the ones now in
the spec. Verifying a claim with the same extractor that will act on it is
one step finer than the PLAYBOOK's "measure the claim", and it is what the
step means.

**Widening a pattern is not separable from the violation it uncovers.**
Fixing SYS-11 turned the two references in `base-typescript` into a smoke
failure, so #1361 and #1362 could not land in separate pull requests
without a red `main` in between. Scoping them as one pull request was
decided during the groom, from the claims, before either was touched.

**Adding the counts to 26 checks would not have closed the class.** The
twenty-seventh check is written by someone who has not read the rule, and a
suite that asks every check to remember a contract gets the checks whose
authors read it — 25 of 26 here, with the rule shipped in the tree the
whole time and enforced on template checks by another runner. The
enforcement moved to the runner: a check that would pass while reporting no
inputs is failed where it is called. Only a silent pass is rejected, since
a failing check has already said something. Recorded as ADR-034, because
the code shows that the runner does this and not why enforcement sits
there.

**Counting alone would not have caught the demonstrated defect.** TPL-08
passed with its directory list pointed at a renamed path, because a missing
directory was skipped with a bare `continue`. The file count is zero
whether the directory is missing or genuinely empty; only naming the absent
directory says which. A corpus root that is not found is now a finding.

**The control that mattered was the one run against the whole suite.**
Emptying `all_template_files()` fails eight checks and exits 1. Every one
of them passed before this session.

**PRs merged:** #1385, #1386, #1387.
**Issues closed:** #1361, #1362, #1367 — milestone #78, 3 of 6.
**Issues opened:** #1388, for the reusable form of the enforcement point.
**Labelled in passing:** #1384, arriving unlabelled from a parallel session
mid-pull-request and tripping the repo-wide label gate; `task`/`P2` on the
precedent of #1367 and #1381, with the precedent commented on the issue.
**ADRs:** ADR-034, the runner rejects a pass reporting no input.
**State at close:** smoke 26/26, sync clean, redundancy 0, conformance 14
passed and 0 failed with all three readings read, 0 open pull requests, no
stale branches, label conformance `[]`, 72 open issues. Milestone #78 holds
#1360, #1366 and #1381 — no tag; the cut is half shipped.

## 2026-09-01 — The wrap-up shipped work after the entry that records it

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** Amendment to the entry above, which named three merged
pull requests and is no longer complete. #1390 merged after it: the
PLAYBOOK's groom step now says to measure a claim with the extractor the
check itself uses, not one written for the measurement. A second entry
rather than an edit, because adding a pull request changes what the record
claims happened.

**The cause is the wrap-up's own ordering, not the audit running twice.**
The journal sits at item 14 of sixteen, placed there in v2.62 with the
reasoning that it is the only item whose output is a record of the others.
Item 15 follows it, and item 15 produces work whenever a flagged gap has a
fix small enough to apply on the spot — which is when a wrap-up should
apply it. Here the doc-placement tree obliged a question about where a
groom refinement belongs, the answer came back PLAYBOOK, and the pull
request merged after the entry. Filed as #1391 with three options; moving
the journal behind item 15 is the smallest.

**Third second-entry in three sessions, first with this cause.** v2.63 and
v2.71 owed one because the wrap-up audit ran twice. This one owes it
because the checklist's own sequence guarantees it whenever the last
reporting item resolves into a change.

**PRs merged:** #1390.
**Issues opened:** #1391.
**State at close:** unchanged from the entry above, except 73 open issues
and `main` at the PLAYBOOK commit.

## 2026-09-01 — The decision a release recorded falsified the recipe that
places the next rule

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** v2.72's second half and the cut. Three issues, three
pull requests, then the changelog cut, the tag and the release.

#1366 — twenty manifest entries are reachable only through the extras and
platform steps of the resolution algorithm, and every reachability check
resolved the seventeen stacks and stopped. Those files were scanned
against zero chains, so they passed by arithmetic: nothing can be missing
from zero chains. `templates/platform/` was outside the scanned
directories entirely. TPL-06 and SYS-11 now resolve thirty-seven roots and
report the two counts separately. The system specification had said the
platform template and each extra are appended as bare files; the
resolution decision record says resolve each one's dependency tree, and
`resolve.py` already did. The specification was the odd one out and the
checks had followed it.

#1381 — a check that resolves its comparison baseline by running a command
inherits a failure no rule covered: the command yields nothing, every
comparison against the empty value succeeds, and the check reports a clean
result from a comparison that never ran. Stated in `base-quality` after
measuring reach — that file and `base-git` both resolve into all
thirty-seven roots, and the rule is about check construction rather than
about git.

#1360 — the model-limitations table an adopter reads to pick a model was
estimated once and never re-measured. The smallest chain in the repository
is 270K characters, roughly 77K tokens; the table claimed 12K and a 32K
minimum. It is now rendered by `sync.py` from the resolved chains, and
`sync.py --check` already runs in CI.

**Widening a check was its own control.** SYS-11 over the opt-in roots
failed on its first run with three real findings — the agents, skills and
issue-format templates each named a `quality-gates` section no chain of
theirs carries. No planted break was needed; the corpus the check had
never opened held the defects it exists to find.

**The rule found two live instances in the file next to it.** `base-git`
shipped two checks with the defect #1381 names. The milestone-coverage
check printed `previous tag: ` and zero references at exit 0. The
off-limits-path check took its base from `git rev-parse`, which echoes an
argument it cannot resolve — so a wrong base looked resolved, the diff
failed, and no changed files read as nothing off limits. A rule shipped in
the same release as its own violations would have been the fifth such
case here.

**The release's own decision record falsified the audit's recipe, and the
audit is where that surfaced.** ADR-035 made an opt-in template a
resolution root. The PLAYBOOK step that picks where a rule goes still
measured reach by iterating the seventeen stacks, and the prose around it
still said platform templates sit outside the chain and that `agents.md`
measures zero. Placement decisions are made with that recipe, so an
under-measure puts a rule in the wrong file. Corrected to iterate a new
`resolve.py --roots`, whose count agrees with the smoke runner's
independent resolver on every file tried.

**The corrected recipe returned zero, and the zero was the bug.** On
Windows `print` emitted CRLF, so each ID reached the shell loop as
`base-agents` with a trailing carriage return, every lookup missed, and
the recipe reported no reach for files carried by all thirty-seven roots.
The old form escaped it by accident: word splitting left the carriage
return on the label rather than the ID. Caught only because the result was
checked against a known value instead of read.

**Two patterns meant for filing were already in the templates.** The rule
that a derivable table must be generated rather than hand-maintained, and
the rule that a control must be shown to have planted its break, are both
stated in `base-quality-gates`. The second was broken twice this session
anyway — once by a revert that discarded unstaged work, once by a control
whose pattern had the wrong line endings and edited nothing while
reporting clean. The repository shipping a rule is not the same as the
session applying it.

**PRs merged:** #1393, #1394, #1395, #1396, #1399, #1400.
**Issues closed:** #1360, #1366, #1381 — milestone #78 complete at 6 of 6,
closed.
**Issues opened:** #1401 and #1402, both reusable patterns with no upstream
home: a generator that substitutes nothing reporting success, and a program
that pins its output encoding but not its line ending.
**Labelled in passing:** #1397 and #1398, arriving unlabelled from a
parallel session and tripping the repo-wide label gate on an unrelated
branch; `bug`/`P2` on the precedent of #1366.
**ADRs:** ADR-035, an orthogonal template is a resolution root and its
reach is measured there.
**Released:** v2.72.0, annotated tag on the changelog cut, published, notes
generated. Eleven commits carried.
**State at close:** smoke 26/26, sync clean, redundancy 0, conformance 14
passed and 0 failed with three readings read, 0 open pull requests, no
stale branches, label conformance `[]`, 74 open issues. Three further
conformance readings appear only while a parallel session's untracked
`docs/design/` sits in the tree; parked, the run returns to the three.

## 2026-09-02 — Every addition was justified and the aggregate was the defect

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** a groom driven by what a rule costs rather than whether it
is true, a feasibility pass over every open ticket, fifteen spikes gathered
into v3.0, and a ceiling on chain size so growth is refused rather than
reported.

**The backlog was measured before it was judged.** Seven hundred and eleven
issues over one hundred and sixty-two days, 89% of them closed, median time
to close one day, and fifteen of six hundred and thirty-six closures
dismissed as duplicate or won't-do. The arithmetic behind "we file more than
we close" is real and thin: 4.4 filed a day against 3.9 closed, a sawtooth
that drains on every cut with about twenty a month of drift underneath. What
the number does not measure is defect pressure. Every one of the seven
hundred and eleven was filed by the maintainer; none came from a consumer.
The backlog measures how hard the project looks at itself.

**Then the templates were measured, and that is where the problem was.**
From `v2.1.0` to `v2.72.0` the corpus went from 387,186 bytes to 782,467 and
from 359 RFC 2119 occurrences to 858, with the file count flat at about
seventy-five. All of it landed inside the files every chain already carries.
The smallest chain, `stack-python-lib`, resolves to 370,154 characters —
roughly 92,500 tokens before a project reads its own context file. Five
files hold 82% of it and all five reach seventeen of seventeen.

**Four tickets were called nits and all four verdicts were wrong.** They had
been judged from their first 380 characters. Read whole, one carried
twenty-two measured readability breaches across thirteen of sixteen records
in a consuming repository; one reproduced `sync.py --check` exiting zero
over a deleted marker; one replaced a destructive config edit with a
non-destructive measurement and showed the naive form printing 366 findings
that read like an answer; one cited twenty-five of twenty-six checks
violating a shipped rule for months. The correction changed the diagnosis
rather than one verdict: there is no population of weak tickets to reject.
Every addition is justified on its own terms, the cost exists only in
aggregate, and that is the trade no single ticket review is positioned to
make. The remedy had to act on the sum.

**So the ceiling caps the sum.** `tests/chain-budget.txt` records a frozen
number for each of the thirty-seven roots — seventeen stacks and twenty
orthogonal templates — and SYS-12 fails on an overage, on a root with no
ceiling, and on a ceiling naming a root that no longer resolves. Frozen at
the measured size rather than given a percentage band, because a band is
spent silently and the point is that the diff states the cost. Shrinking
passes freely. `sync.py` had measured the same numbers for the README table
all along and never refused one.

**The controls made the blast radius the visible part.** Forty-seven
characters appended to `core/quality.md` failed all thirty-seven roots. A
deleted ceiling failed as unmeasured and printed the line to restore. A
ceiling for a root that does not resolve failed as stale. Each mutation was
asserted before its result was read.

**The measuring script was wrong before any ticket was.** A citation checker
called thirty-three of seventy-one tickets stale; the control that had to
fail said the detectors worked, so the corpus was the suspect. It was
reading bare filenames like `manifest.yaml` as missing paths and did not
know stack IDs carry a `stack-` prefix. Fixed, the count fell to fifteen,
and reading those fifteen left three: `docs/patterns/agent-context-tradeoffs.md`
moved to `docs/meta/` in May and three spikes still pointed at the old path.
Six citations rewritten, each verified by re-fetching the issue rather than
trusting the exit status. A `head -3` on a README grep nearly produced a
fourth, false, stale verdict in the other direction.

**Feasibility came out better than expected.** All eleven open bugs were
re-measured against the tree and all eleven still hold, including the six
scoped into v2.73. Thirty-one percent of open tickets state no acceptance
criterion, and eight of those are spikes, where the output is a decision.
The one hard blocker is #1292 behind #1291.

**The parallel session wrote into the tree and then took it back.** Mid-run,
`SPEC.md`, `sync.py`, `CLAUDE.md` and the PLAYBOOK appeared modified —
608 deletions in `SPEC.md`, `#1365`'s premise gone — and v2.73 was declared
blocked. Twenty minutes later the tree was clean, `main` had not moved and
no pull request existed: the work had been discarded, not landed. The
milestone was never actually at risk. Two issues arriving unlabelled from
the same session reddened this session's pull request twice through the
repo-wide label gate.

**PRs merged:** #1409, #1411.
**Issues closed:** #1407, and six in the groom — #297 and #298 on the ADR
that makes an unreferenced template a root rather than a gap, #299 answered
by that same record, #303 whose two halves both lost their premise, #618
which asked for no work, #714 as a duplicate of #1291.
**Issues opened:** #1407, the chain ceiling.
**Labelled in passing:** #1408 and #1410, both `task`/`P2` on the precedent
of #1401, both the same false-green class.
**ADRs:** ADR-036, chain size is capped by a frozen ceiling rather than
merely reported.
**Milestones:** `v2.73 — A specification its resolver never ran, and a
procedure written down twice` created and scoped to six issues, with the
ordering constraint recorded in its description: the two template fixes land
before the PLAYBOOK is made to defer, or deferring propagates the defect.
Fifteen spikes and two dependents moved into v3.0 at the owner's
instruction, taking it to twenty-seven.
**State at close:** smoke 27/27, sync clean, redundancy 0, conformance 14
passed and 0 failed with five readings read, 0 open pull requests, no stale
branches, label conformance `[]`, 73 open issues.

## 2026-09-02 — The wrap-up filed an issue after the entry that lists them

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** none to the tree. This entry exists because the previous
one is now incomplete and a record is fixed in what it claims.

**The entry above lists one issue opened and there were two.** Item 15 of
the audit, flag gaps, found that the groom procedure's closing sentence —
"grooming produces annotations and a milestone, not edits" — forbids the one
edit a groom is best placed to make: retiring an issue whose premise a
merged decision record has already settled. Six such closures happened
earlier in this session. That became #1413, filed after item 14 had written
the entry naming #1407 alone.

**This is the fourth time and the second from this cause.** The ordering
defect is already filed as #1391: the journal sits at item 14 of sixteen,
its own text says it is last because it records the others, and items 15 and
16 follow it. The three earlier recurrences came from the audit running
twice in a session. This one came from the ordering itself, which is what
#1391 predicts and what its first option — move the journal after item 15,
leaving only the summary behind it — would have prevented. The cost is
exactly as described there: an entry's account is fixed once written, so the
correction is a second entry rather than an edit.

**Nothing else moved.** No pull request beyond the journal ones, no template
change, no gate affected.

**Issues opened:** #1413, the groom procedure forbidding the closure a groom
is best placed to make. Together with #1407 this makes two for the session.
**State at close:** unchanged from the entry above except the issue count —
smoke 27/27, sync clean, redundancy 0, label conformance `[]`, 0 open pull
requests, 74 open issues.

## 2026-09-03 — Three cuts, and a control that lied in the shape just shipped

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** three releases, fourteen pull requests, seventeen issues
closed. `v2.73.0` corrected the changelog preamble's own count and narrowed
the Decision-logs trigger so a content move no longer mandates a record.
`v2.74.0` closed the specification-versus-resolver pair — SPEC's resolution
algorithm no longer appends a file the resolver never appended, `sync.py`
holds one manifest parser instead of two divergent copies, `base-git` tags
the release commit by name and ships `--verify-tag`, and the PLAYBOOK defers
to it rather than restating it. `v2.75.0` added six rules for checks that
report success without having tested anything.

**The chain-budget gate shaped every template change.** SYS-12 refused four
of them and each was compressed rather than granted its first ask: 555 to
176, 561 to 444, 823 to 745, 887 to 640, 934 to 760. Compression stopped in
each case where the next cut would have removed the mechanism rather than
the wording. The gate merged one day earlier is now the thing that decides
how much prose a rule may cost.

**A control I ran returned the reassuring answer, and it was wrong.**
Verifying #1401's claim about the generator, a marker-deletion plant reported
`exit=0` and read as the generator being blind. The plant never landed: the
working tree is CRLF under `core.autocrlf` and the pattern ended in a bare
newline, so marker occurrences went from two to two. The corrected control
asserted the plant landed first and reported `exit=1` — the generator already
carried the destination check, fixed while implementing #1360. This is
#1425's rule, merged forty minutes earlier in the same session, and
`CLAUDE.md` had carried the general form including the line-endings cause
since before the session began. Having the rule loaded on every turn did not
prevent the failure.

**A commit message asserted a measurement this session had not taken.** The
first draft of the #1401 commit reported the issue's original figure in a
tense claiming it about the current tree. Corrected before the pull request
opened, by deleting the un-published branch and re-pushing rather than
force-pushing. `CLAUDE.md` 6.2 now carries the rule.

**A milestone was renumbered rather than dissolved.** `v2.73` was themed for
six unstarted issues while five unrelated ones had merged, and #1407 had been
put in it solely to satisfy the release gate. The scoped milestone moved to
`v2.74` intact and a new `v2.73` was created under a theme matching what
shipped. Recorded in the PLAYBOOK's groom section.

**The milestone-coverage check reported a false finding and was not
satisfied.** It named #1413, an open issue a commit subject mentions without
closing. Milestoning it would have made the gate green over a milestone that
had stopped describing its release. The gate defect is #1422; the
operator-side rule is #1436.

**Grooms:** the unmilestoned set and all of `v3.0` were read whole. Nine
issues left v3.0 — six conditional on an unresolved predecessor, three a
launch cluster held behind an architectural decision none of them needs.
Removing them raised v3.0's spike ratio from 54% to 63%, which is what it
actually is. `v2.75` was scoped from the remaining clusters and shipped the
same day.

**Pull requests merged:** #1418, #1419, #1421, #1423, #1426, #1427, #1428,
#1429, #1430, #1431, #1432, #1433, #1434, #1437.
**Issues closed:** #1125, #1363, #1364, #1365, #1369, #1370, #1371, #1372,
#1373, #1378, #1384, #1388, #1401, #1410, #1415, #1416, #1425.
**Issues opened:** #1417, #1420, #1422 and #1436 from this session; #1424,
#1425 and #1435 arrived from a parallel session and were labelled on the way
past.
**Upstream:** #1436 is the one reusable pattern filed — a gate finding is
cleared by changing the condition, never the input the gate reads.
**Milestones:** `v2.73`, `v2.74` and `v2.75` created, scoped, shipped and
closed. `v3.0` reduced from 28 to 19.
**State at close:** smoke 27/27, sync clean, redundancy 0, conformance 14
passed and 0 failed with four readings read, 0 open pull requests, no stale
branches, label conformance `[]`, 66 open issues.

## 2026-09-03 — The wrap-up fixed the ordering it was running under

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `v2.76.0`, six issues on this repository's own procedure
loop disagreeing with itself. This is the session's second entry and the
first one owed for a reason the rules now endorse: the entry above was
written at the last pass of that audit and this is work that followed it.

**The audit's ordering is fixed, and this pass is the first to run under
it.** The dev journal sat at item 11 of 13 in `base-scope` and 14 of 16 in
`CLAUDE.md` while its own text said it was last because it records the
others. Flagging a gap is a reporting step until the gap has a fix small
enough to apply on the spot, which is when a wrap-up should apply one, and
four second entries had been owed. The two items are swapped. The earlier
wrap-up today dodged the defect by assessing item 15 before writing item 14
— a workaround that had to be remembered, and is now unnecessary.

**Which pass owns the entry is stated for the first time.** The rule
assumed the checklist runs once; a session cutting a release runs it twice.
Both documents now say the last pass writes it and an earlier one records
that the session owes it. The release procedure already said so from its
side and nothing said it from the audit's.

**A gate was fixed before the rule about it was written.** The
milestone-coverage check resolved every issue number in a commit subject,
so an issue a pull request merely names sat where one it closed sits. It
reported open backlog #1413 as unaccounted-for release work during the
`v2.73.0` cut. #1422 landed before #1436 deliberately: writing the
operator-side rule against a check still producing the false finding would
have described a defect the reader could still reproduce. The fixed check
now reports how many open issues it skipped, and this cut's own pre-release
run printed `0 open issue(s) named in passing` — a field that did not exist
one release earlier.

**The third scheduling state is the absence of the other two.** 41 of 48
unmilestoned issues carried no trigger, so the deferral rule was honoured
by 15% of the set it governs and silence meant three different things.
Readiness was considered as a third value and rejected: a trigger is a
question and survives neglect, an answer ages from the day it is written.
The objection came from the owner, from having had issues marked ready that
stopped being ready, and it is the same reasoning
`testing-negative-assertion-coverage` uses to prefer a sentinel over an
empty default.

**A groom may close what a merged change has settled.** The closing rule
forbade edits in general, so the one edit a groom is uniquely placed to
make read as forbidden. Seven such closures had happened across two grooms
while the paragraph prohibited them.

**CRLF produced a second false edit in one day.** Editing `base-scope`, an
anchor ending in a bare newline matched nothing against a working tree
`core.autocrlf` writes as CRLF. It was caught by asserting the anchor count
before writing, which is what `CLAUDE.md` already required and what the
morning's control had skipped.

**Pull requests merged:** #1439, #1440, #1441, #1442, #1443.
**Issues closed:** #1262, #1391, #1413, #1420, #1422, #1436.
**Issues opened:** none.
**Upstream:** all four patterns landed in `templates/` in the pull requests
that introduced them, so nothing was left downstream-only. #1248 remains
owed.
**Milestones:** `v2.76 — A record written before the work it records, and a
gate cleared by editing what it reads` created, scoped, shipped and closed.
**State at close:** smoke 27/27, sync clean, redundancy 0, conformance 14
passed and 0 failed with four readings read, 0 open pull requests, no stale
branches, label conformance `[]`, 60 open issues and 41 unmilestoned.

## 2026-09-03 — The audit refused the cut, and found the cut's own defect

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `v2.77.0`, six issues on what a producer decides for a
consumer it cannot see, plus a 360-degree audit that blocked the tag and then
found a violated rule inside the release candidate. Third entry of the day and
the first written under the ordering the entry above installed — item 11's
PLAYBOOK fix exists because item 14 flagged it and the fix was small enough to
apply, which is the sequence that was broken this morning.

**The periodic-review gate is real and had been skipped four times.** It
refused `v2.77.0` because the newest audit record predated the previous tag.
The same arithmetic holds for `v2.73.0`, `v2.74.0` and `v2.75.0`; the check
landed 2026-09-01 and was correct throughout. The cause is structural and now
filed as #1455: `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` deliberately gives the pre-release checks no
step number, reasoning that a number would drift from the sequence in
`base-git` that owns them. That reasoning is sound and its consequence is that
an operator working the numbered list finishes having never run them — there is
no blank to leave. Two remedies are named in the issue and neither was chosen
here, because choosing one is the decision the ticket exists to make.

**Seven isolated reviewers, and convergence treated as evidence.** Overall
`C-`, down from `C+`; six dimensions fell or held and none rose. That reads
worse than it is. Every prior High closed, and both prior bottlenecks — SYS-11
seeing 124 of 366 identifiers, and the model-limitations table understating
every chain — are verified gone, the first with an injected control that fires
on exactly the identifiers it used to miss. The reviewers, not spending their
budget re-deriving last time's findings, looked one layer down. Three
dimensions independently reached the committed CRLF, three the chain-budget
ratchet, and three the Cursor output-file contradiction.

**The named bottleneck is the chain budget, and it is SYS-11's successor in
shape.** 313 per-root ceiling raises and zero lowers across 16 commits, all 37
roots now at exactly zero headroom, and SYS-12 reports only the minimum
headroom — so padding one ceiling leaves the output byte-identical to an honest
tree. The file's own text says the numbers are frozen at what the tree
measured, not padded with a band; nothing enforces that and nothing can reveal
its breach. I leaned on that mechanism five times during this release. Filed as
#1462 with the honest qualifier that the ratchet is not fake: controls confirm
it fires when a ceiling is lowered or removed.

**Two issues I filed carried measurements my own merged pull requests had
already invalidated.** #1453 cited a `grep` returning 0 that my #1404 bullet
had made 1 eleven minutes earlier; #1446 asserted the index was clean and
`v2.77.0`'s own #1451 falsified it seventeen minutes later, while my `sync.py`
runs moved its file count from 190 to 183. Both corrected in place with
comments. `CLAUDE.md` already carries the rule I broke, which is the part worth
recording — a second copy of a rule would not have helped, and the failure was
carrying a number across a merge rather than not knowing the rule.

**Post-mortem — #1456, a template shipped with committed CRLF (P1).**

- **Symptom:** `templates/base/language/python.md` was committed with 146 CRLF
  pairs and one doubled carriage return, violating `base-quality`'s rule that
  committed line endings MUST be LF. It was the only such file in the
  repository, and it landed one commit after the release rule that a program
  pins its line ending as well as its encoding.
- **Root cause:** the append that added the Logging section did
  `text.rstrip(chr(10))` on a CRLF file. That strips the newline and leaves the
  carriage return, so writing `\r\n` after it produced `\r\r\n`. The lone CR is
  what mattered: `.gitattributes` declares `* text=auto eol=lf`, and `text=auto`
  is a heuristic that classifies a blob with a stray CR as binary and skips
  normalisation. Git filed it `i/-text`, not `i/crlf`.
- **Why missed:** the check this project ships for exactly this failure matched
  `i/crlf`. It printed nothing, passed, and was reported PASS in the same
  conformance run that carried the violation, with smoke 27/27 and CI green.
  Every gate was working as written; the pattern was narrower than its subject.
  Review did not catch it either, because the diff read as a whole-file rewrite
  and that is what a binary-classified blob always looks like.
- **Fix:** PR #1457 — the file normalised (pairs collapsed and the stray CR
  stripped, in that order, since a pair-only fix leaves the CR and the binary
  classification with it), and the check widened to match any known-text path
  that is not `i/lf`. Deliberately not done: the 183 working-tree CRLF files
  #1446 covers were left alone, because renormalising the tree is a separate
  change with its own destructive-command hazard.
- **Prevention:** the widened check ships to every consuming project, so the
  class is closed rather than the instance. It was control-tested in a
  throwaway repository carrying the exact shape — the old form finds 0 rows
  there and the new form 1, while a plain-CRLF file normalises to `i/lf` and is
  correctly ignored. #1463 was filed for the two programs that write committed
  artifacts without pinning a newline, which are the likeliest source of the
  next stray byte.

**The control is what caught my second mistake, not my judgement.** The first
widened pattern split on whitespace and matched nothing, because only the path
in `git ls-files --eol` is tab-delimited and `$4` lands inside the attribute
list. It came out clean on the real tree and would have shipped as a
green-forever check. It failed the direction that must fail, which is the only
reason it was found. That is the same lesson as the morning's entry, arriving
by a different route: a check verified only where it should pass has not been
verified.

**A gate can exit 0 while printing a finding.** milestone-coverage reported
that a subject named closed issue #1456 carrying no milestone, and exited 0.
Its pass condition is prose — prints nothing after the counts — and I had
printed `exit=$?` beside it. #1456 was assigned and the check re-run before the
tag. The operator half landed in `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` (#1477); the generalisable
half, how a shipped check signals a finding at all, is #1478.

**Pull requests merged:** #1447, #1448, #1449, #1450, #1451, #1452, #1457,
#1475, #1476, #1477.
**Issues closed:** #1402, #1404, #1405, #1424, #1435, #1445, #1456.
**Issues opened:** #1446, #1453, #1454, #1455, #1456, #1458 through #1474,
#1478 — 23 in total, 17 of them from the audit.
**Upstream:** six of the seven patterns landed in `templates/` in the pull
requests that introduced them. The seventh split: the operator guidance is
project-specific and went to the PLAYBOOK, the reusable half is #1478 against
`base-quality-gates`. #1248 remains owed.
**Milestones:** `v2.77.0 — What a producer decides for a consumer it cannot
see` created, scoped, shipped and closed at 7 issues.
**State at close:** smoke 27/27, sync clean, resolve clean, redundancy 0,
conformance 14 passed and 0 failed with two readings read, 0 open pull
requests, no stale branches, label conformance `[]`, 78 open issues and 6 open
P1s — five of them filed today and none milestoned, which is the gap flagged at
item 14 and left for the owner to scope.

## 2026-09-03 — The owner read a finding and rejected the premise under it

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** no template changed. The session's fourth entry and its second
close-out, owed because the entry above was written before this work existed
and `docs-record-amendment` fixes an entry's account once written. Nothing here
amends it; this is what followed.

**A finding was read, found obscure, and the obscurity was the signal.** #1462
reported that the chain ceiling had been raised 313 times and lowered none. The
owner said twice that it did not read clearly, which was fair — the issue
described a mechanism and buried what it meant. Restated concretely, as a speed
limit that raises itself to your speed every time you pass it, the response was
not "now I understand the ceiling" but "this is a sign the concept is failing".
That is the more valuable reading, and it was available in the same
measurements the audit had already taken.

**The stated design is an hourglass: a tight core that barely changes, with
rich integration above and below.** Measured against it, the shape has
inverted. `base/core` plus `base/workflow` is 61.1% of template bytes and took
102 edits since `v2.55.0`; `stack`, `backend`, `frontend` and `platform`
together are 30.1% and took 16. `backend/` holds more files than any other
layer and has not been touched in 22 releases. The average waist file is 26KB
against 4KB at the ends — seven to one, the wrong way. Nothing has ever been
deleted.

**The composition test came from the owner's model, not from me.** A rule
belongs in the waist only if changing the stack, the platform, or the team's
way of working would not change it. Applied to all 226 H2 sections of the 21
waist files: 38.4% keep, 49.3% is an operating manual for running an
agent-assisted repository, 11.1% belongs at a stack or platform end, 1.1% is
Python mechanics in a stack-agnostic file. `core/git.md` is 88% process — its
invariant content is 7.5KB of a 63KB file. Nine files are wholly process and
move intact; four are wholly core, and they are `config`, `readme`, `oop` and
`release`, which is close to the shape the project set out to build.

**Re-resolving all 37 roots with the non-keep sections removed cuts a mean of
44%** — the floor from roughly 67k tokens to 35k, the ceiling from 116k to 72k.
Filed as #1480, P1 spike, with four judgement calls flagged as the ones to
argue with first and the whole classification reproducible from the issue.

**The two v3.0 questions turned out to constrain each other, and neither issue
said so.** #712 is delivery — a referenced template loads nothing, so a
reference is progressive disclosure with the engine removed. #1480 is
composition. Under #712's finding, moving the process layer out and delivering
it by reference is not a middle position, it is deletion with a pointer left
behind: 233KB would stop reaching any agent while the project read as having
kept it. That leaves three real options and makes a skill the only one that
keeps the material reachable without charging every consumer — which is what
`core/skills.md` already says skills are for. Cross-referenced both ways, with
the ordering stated: composition first, delivery second.

**The brake is the deliverable, not the split.** Without a stated test the
waist refills by the mechanism that filled it: nobody adds to the core
deliberately, they add to whichever file already discusses the topic. Every
rule this session shipped went in that way and each was individually defensible
— `quality.md` gained two, and `quality.md` is 58KB. The test is acceptance
criterion 3 of #1480 rather than its own issue, because stating it before the
split is decided announces a bar the corpus fails in 226 places.

**Pull requests merged:** none since the entry above.
**Issues closed:** none.
**Issues opened:** #1478, #1480.
**Upstream:** the invariance test is reusable and is deliberately unwritten,
held as acceptance criterion 3 of #1480. `core/agents.md:52` already carries
"Signal density over length", which is the same instinct with no criterion
behind it and is the likely home.
**Milestones:** unchanged; #1480 is unmilestoned and is the largest open
question in the repository.
**State at close:** smoke 27/27, sync clean, resolve clean, redundancy 0,
conformance 14 passed and 0 failed with three readings read, 0 open pull
requests, no stale branches, label conformance `[]`, 78 open issues, 7 open P1s
of which 6 are unmilestoned. No template changed since `v2.77.0`, so the 44%
is a measurement of a proposal and not a result.

## 2026-09-03 — The project adopted the communication template it authors

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `CLAUDE.md` section 7. Third close-out of the day and a third
entry, owed because the entry above closes with "Pull requests merged: none
since the entry above" and #1482 falsified that line eleven minutes later.

**A template this project wrote had never been applied to it.**
`base-communication` shipped in #1280 and defines brevity, stating a preferred
option, asking before assuming scope, and three shorthand verbs. `CLAUDE.md`
carried no communication rules at all, so the register was set per session by
inference — which is how a session ends up applying brevity to edit recaps and
not to a seven-dimension audit report. The owner asked for the official style
and the fix was to inline the file that already existed.

**Inlined rather than referenced**, per the inline model section 1.1 declares,
and **appended as section 7 rather than renumbering**: `docs/dev-journal.md`
cites CLAUDE.md section numbers in ten places and those are fixed accounts.
Renumbering would have broken every one silently, in a file whose own rule says
a cross-reference is corrected in place because a stale pointer defeats the
document's purpose. Appending avoided the question rather than answering it.

**Section 7.2 carries two additions the template permits, and both are
corrections this session earned rather than inventions.** Brevity applies to
analysis and audit reporting, not only to edit recaps. And when a finding is
called unclear, restate it concretely rather than defending the wording — #1462
was defended twice before the plain restatement produced the diagnosis that
mattered.

**The reusable half is that nothing requires a consumer to carry a
communication contract at all.** `grep -c communication` returns 0 in both
`base-agents` and `base-scope`, the two files governing what a context file
must contain; `agents.md` requires ONBOARDING and PLAYBOOK as companion
documents and says nothing about this. So every consumer's agent starts by
guessing tone and verbosity. Filed as #1483. This repository is the evidence
for it: it authored the template and did not adopt it for the template's whole
life.

**The new section is unenforced and looks like every other answer when
violated.** No check reads it, which puts it in the class
`quality-gates-pair-check` names — a stated constraint with no check is
decorative and decays silently. The owner will notice a breach before any gate
does. Recorded rather than solved, because the check for "was that answer
concise" is not obviously writable.

**Pull requests merged:** #1482.
**Issues closed:** none.
**Issues opened:** #1483.
**Upstream:** the project-specific half is `CLAUDE.md` section 7; the reusable
half is #1483 against `base-agents`. #1480 classifies `base-communication` as
process-layer material, so if that split happens this requirement travels with
it.
**Milestones:** unchanged. 79 open issues, 7 open P1s, 6 of them unmilestoned.
**State at close:** smoke 27/27, sync clean, redundancy 0, conformance 14
passed and 0 failed with three readings read, 0 open pull requests, no stale
branches, label conformance `[]`.
## 2026-09-03 — Five documents that denied their tooling, and a rule that got shorter

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `v2.78.0` released — five P1 bugs from yesterday's 360 audit,
all one shape, plus the wrap-up that found a sixth instance of the same shape
in the file the fix had trusted. The fifth entry dated today and the fourth
close-out; the ordering installed this morning held, and item 14 again produced
work that item 15 could name.

**The five were one defect wearing five faces: a prose document asserting
something false about the tooling it describes.** The PLAYBOOK said
`resolve.py` takes no `--check` and that an unknown flag reads as a clean gate;
the flag exists, CI runs it as a required step, and `--bogus` exits 1.
CONTRIBUTING told an external contributor the checks need no dependency beyond
Python; with PyYAML shadowed, 14 of 28 fail. INTERVIEW instructed an agent to
run `resolve.py <stack-id>` from a table that shipped 17 file paths and no ids.
README told an adopter to walk `[DEPENDS ON]`, which cannot reach the core
tier. And `base/core/git.md` required a record of each pre-release step run by
hand — for one step out of eight, which is how four minor cuts shipped owing a
periodic review under a gate that was correct the whole time.

**None of the five was detectable by the method that had graded them PASS.**
Yesterday's audit ran the commands each document names. That cannot catch a
document asserting a command does not exist, because there is no command to
run. The negative case is the method it needed: for each claim that X does not
work, run X.

**A rule got wider by getting shorter.** #1455's fix wanted the record
requirement to cover the whole sequence. Written as its own paragraph in
`base/core/git.md` it cost 472 characters and SYS-12 failed all 37 roots — the
ceilings sit at zero headroom, so any core growth trips it, which is ADR-036
working exactly as designed. Tightening reached -90. Folding the widened rule
into the paragraph that already carried the narrow one came out **98 characters
shorter than the text it replaced**: +8 headroom, no ceiling raised. The
ratchet has been raised 313 times and lowered none, per #1462; this is one
piece of evidence that a raise is sometimes a failure of drafting rather than a
real cost. Recorded in the PLAYBOOK as the step to try before paying.

**The cut was the first release proposal written under the rule it shipped.**
#1492's body names all eight pre-release steps and each result, including the
ones this repository's PLAYBOOK deliberately leaves unnumbered. Two steps
needed more than an exit code. Step 2 reports 425 unreachable commits, and the
count answers nothing on its own: categorising by subject against `main`
requires stripping *every* trailing `(#N)` group from both sides, because a
squash appends its own number to a subject that may already carry issue
numbers. Stripping one leaves the sides a group apart and 174 read as
unexplained; stripping all leaves 30, being 12 merge commits and 18
intermediate commits of squashed pull requests. Step 5's `gh run list
--workflow` prints `0` and exits `0` for a workflow with no runs, so the name
was verified against a 404 before the 42 was believed.

**A control satisfied its precondition without running the code, and nearly
exonerated the wrong thing.** Establishing whether `sync.py` writes CRLF: I
normalised `INTERVIEW.md` to LF, ran the tool, and it stayed LF. Read at face
value the tool is innocent. It is not — `sync.py` writes only when the
generated block differs, so a file already in sync is never opened. Staling the
block first reversed the verdict, and the mid-flight correction to #1489's body
was the second time today a stated cause had to be withdrawn. The three control
rules in `CLAUDE.md` section 6.2 do not catch this: the plant landed, and no
earlier layer raised. The run simply had nothing to do. Added as a fourth rule
on the owner's call, and filed as #1493 for `quality-gates.md`, where the
sibling rules also do not ship.

**The wrap-up found the sixth face of the same defect in the file the fix had
trusted.** #1459's acceptance criterion named ONBOARDING as the document
CONTRIBUTING should match. ONBOARDING says, one line above naming PyYAML, "No
build step, no dependencies to install." The corrected file was corrected
against a file carrying the same contradiction.

**Three rules this repository applies and ships to nobody.** #1493, #1494 and
#1495 — the control rule above, refusing a run when the suite's own
precondition is missing rather than reporting 14 findings about a clean tree,
and the rule that a stated measurement belongs to the tree it was taken on.
That last one was load-bearing again today: #1460 claimed 65 misses over 20
files and the tree gave 38 over 3, the defect real and the magnitude stale.
This is v2.78's theme one level up — not a document contradicting the tooling,
but a practice the templates never learned.

**Pull requests merged:** #1485, #1487, #1488, #1489, #1491, #1492 (the cut),
#1496 (the wrap-up).
**Issues closed:** #1455, #1458, #1459, #1460, #1461.
**Issues opened:** #1490, #1493, #1494, #1495. Labelled for the parallel
session: #1486, #1497.
**Upstream:** ADR-037 and the widened record rule are in `base/core/git.md`
already. The three reusable rules are #1493 and #1494 against
`quality-gates.md` and #1495 against `ai-workflow.md`, each naming candidate
files rather than picking one, since ADR-028 wants both files' chain reach
measured first. Project-specific: the fold-before-raising technique, since the
chain budget is this repository's own mechanism.
**Milestones:** #84 closed at 11/11. 78 open issues, 2 open P1s — #1480 and
#712, which are the next real question and are a v3.0 groom rather than a cut.
**Owed and not repaired:** `v2.77.0`'s publication is not journalled. The entry
above it records that release's issues and the audit that blocked its tag;
nothing records the tag and release being cut, that happened in a previous
session, and an entry of mine dated today would misattribute it.
**State at close:** smoke 28/28, sync clean, redundancy 0, conformance 14
passed and 0 failed with two readings read, 0 open pull requests, no stale
branches, label conformance `[]`. 164 working-tree files still carry
pre-`.gitattributes` CRLF against 0 committed blobs, tracked as #1490.

## 2026-09-05 — The instruments measured the wrong corpus, and so did the controls

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `v2.79.0` released — six issues where the front door described
a repository that does not exist — then half of `v2.80`, which is about the
tools that measure this project being pointed at part of it. A backlog groom
took 80 open issues to 70. A parallel session's policy PR was reviewed, fixed
and merged. This entry discharges the one `v2.79.0` owed and covers the
session that followed it.

**`v2.79.0` — the documents an adopter reads first.** ONBOARDING sent
contributors to Discussions that are disabled. dependabot declared a pip
ecosystem with no Python manifest to read. CLAUDE.md required an approving
review that branch protection does not require and the sole maintainer cannot
give. The homepage pointed at a site mentioning the project zero times. The
adopter path ran `py`, absent from macOS and Linux, while README named no
Python prerequisite. Two shipped tables disagreed on Cursor's output file and
README followed the one no stack chain carries. README vendored the submodule
at `.ai-templates` while INTERVIEW.md — what an agent actually executes —
instructs `docs/solid-ai-templates`. Six issues, four pull requests.

**The measurement theme, which the cut surfaced by accident.** Fixing the
Cursor mapping meant editing `base-docs`, which is core tier, so every chain
grew ten characters. SYS-12 reported all 37 roots two over rather than ten.
The recorded ceilings had been carrying eight characters of slack from an
earlier shrink, because the check fails when a chain exceeds its ceiling and a
shrink passes freely. That is #1462's mechanism, met in the diff rather than
in the issue.

**`v2.80` is that observation generalised.** `audit_redundancy.py` looped over
stacks, so it resolved 17 of the 37 roots a project can pick and never read a
single `platform/` file or opt-in extra. Widened, near-duplicates went 3 to 6,
and the widest newly visible pair scores 0.99: `git.md` and `release.md` both
carry a `Versioning` section and both resolve into `base-release`, so a
project picking that extra receives the rule twice. It was invisible from two
directions at once — outside the scanned roots, and below the gated tier.
ADR-038 settles the second: `--check` keeps gating exact duplicates only and
now prints the near count beside its verdict, so a passing gate states what it
did not gate. Memoising the ratio on the rule pair took `--check` from 58s to
7s; it does not depend on the chain, and the core tier is in all 37.

`resolve.py` took `args[0]` and ignored the rest, so a root that does not
exist passed silently when it followed a valid one — exit 0 on the wrong
chain, while the same argument alone exits 1. The validation existed; the
second position never reached it. Roots are refused rather than composed,
since ADR-035 has each resolving on its own. SYS-14 covers six argument shapes
and asserts a phrase from each message, because a program exiting 1 for the
wrong reason reads identically to one exiting 1 for the right one.

**Four controls were wrong before they were right, and each failed a
different way.** A planted prose section proved nothing against a detector
that fingerprints bullet lines: the gate reported clean and that read as the
gate holding. `git checkout -- <path>` restored `audit_redundancy.py` from the
index and silently discarded the memo, because an older version had been
staged. An exit code was read after a pipe, so `$?` was `tail`'s. And a chain
figure reported as taken on `main` had been taken on `docs/issue-pr-formatting`
— the parallel session moved HEAD in the shared checkout mid-measurement. The
first three are already rules in CLAUDE.md 6.2; the fourth was not, and the
existing `pwd` rule does not cover a wrong branch in a right directory. Both
gaps are now rules there.

**The parallel session.** #1508 raises the ADR threshold and makes template
adoption selective. Review found one measurable defect: it removes a large
amount of core-tier text and left every ceiling untouched, so all 37 became
padded by 550 to 2061 characters, 33869 in total, against 0 on `main`. Its own
validation line — "all 37 chain ceilings without increases" — is accurate and
cannot distinguish that from a clean result, because SYS-12 only fails upward.
Two other findings were withdrawn: the ADR immutability and precedence rules
are not deleted, they survive reworded, and the greps had searched the old
phrasings.

**Groom.** 80 to 70. Every mechanically checkable claim in the backlog was
re-measured against the tree with a control on each probe, and **nothing had
been silently fixed** — closure came only from subsumption. #350's four axes
had been split into `audit_redundancy.py`, #1471, #368 and #1184; #369 was
#368 with one extra variable; #1490 and #1470 were subsets whose unique
content was ported before closing. Seven issues now carry an explicit trigger
condition rather than an implicit deferral.

**Pull requests merged:** #1499, #1500, #1501, #1502, #1503 (the cut), #1507,
#1508 (the parallel session's), #1510, #1513 (the wrap-up).
**Issues closed:** #1374, #1375, #1377, #1472, #1473, #1474 in `v2.79.0`;
#1464 and #1466 in `v2.80`; #350, #369, #1470, #1490 as duplicates.
**Issues opened:** none. Four findings were surfaced and deliberately left
unfiled, listed under Owed below.
**Upstream:** two reusable patterns, neither filed. A CLI validating every
argument rather than dropping the unparsed ones belongs in `base/core/cli.md`,
which covers `main(argv) -> int` and shared parsing but not this. A gate with
an advisory tier reporting that tier's count on every run belongs in
`quality-gates.md`, where the word "advisory" does not appear. Project-specific:
rebasing the ceilings down on a shrink, since `chain-budget.txt` is this
repository's own instrument and #1462 owns the general form.
**Milestones:** #85 closed at 11/11 for `v2.79.0`. #86 (`v2.80`) is open at
2 of 4, deliberately — #1465 is small and #1471 asks what 21% of the corpus is
for, which #1480 re-asks in a wider frame.
**Owed and not repaired:** `v2.80` is not cut. #1471 was proposed for
reassignment to #1480's orbit and not moved. Two defects are unfiled: SYS-07
walks gitignored paths, so any local worktree turns it red while CI stays
green, and `360.md:504` ships `py tests/run_smoke.py SYS-07` — this
repository's own runner and check id — inside a template no consumer can run.
**State at close:** smoke 29/29, sync clean, `resolve.py --check` clean,
redundancy 0, conformance 14 passed and 0 failed with three readings read, 0
open pull requests, no stale branches of mine, label conformance `[]`. The
shared checkout sits on the parallel session's branch with two of its
worktrees and one stash outstanding, none of it mine to remove.

## 2026-09-06 — What the gates cannot see

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `v2.81.0` released, from a milestone scoped this session out
of the four open findings of the previous day's 360 audit plus the template
feedback that generalises them. Five defects, one shape: a check certifying
something it never looked at.

The load-bearing one was the template corpus. `all_template_files()` read a
hardcoded twelve-directory list with a non-recursive `os.listdir` and defined
what six authoring checks could see. A planted `templates/rogue.md` declaring
a duplicate `base-git` and an empty section passed the whole gate stack; it
now fails three checks, and the scanned count moves from 74 to 75 — which is
what makes the count worth printing. The conformance runner's `os.walk` and
TPL-08's six-directory walk went the same way, onto one enumeration in
`lib.py` built from `git ls-files`.

The composition defect had been shipping for months. `docs/SPEC.md` calls two
templates overriding one ID an error and states no winner; `stack-tutorial`
did it three times, carrying two contradictory bodies for
`static-site-content`. No check counted multiplicity. Both templates now
follow the pattern `go-lib` → `go-service` → `go-echo` already used without
anyone stating it, TPL-10 fails a chain that overrides an ID twice, and
ADR-039 records the choice against the live alternative of letting the later
template win.

The README claimed OWASP and no chain carried it; CSRF reached one chain of
seventeen, so a Django, Flask, Express or NestJS adopter had no CSRF rule at
all. `base-security` gains the section and names the standard, taking OWASP
from 0 chains to 12 and CSRF from 1 to 13. Measuring that turned up something
worse and separate, filed as its own issue: `stack-htmx` is a server-rendered
web stack whose nine-file chain carries no security file whatsoever.

`docs/meta/` was renamed to `docs/design/` rather than the newcomer moving
into it, on the user's call. Its arrival had also flipped the register check
into a permanent reading — a standing finding is one a reader learns to
dismiss — so chapters 12 and 14 adopted the id convention, and the check's
output was reshaped into three lines a predicate can read. Conformance went
from six checks awaiting a reading to three.

The last one generalises the first: a figure a document states about the tree
must come from a generator, or not be stated. The rule ships with its check,
this repository had seven violations in prose, and the counts were available
from `resolve.py --roots` throughout.

**PRs merged:** #1533, #1534, #1536, #1537, #1538, #1539 (the cut), #1540
(ADR-039), #1541 (PLAYBOOK)

**Issues closed:** #1525, #1526, #1527, #1528, #1530

**Issues created:** #1535 (HTMX ships no security rules, P1), #1542 (the
gated-figure check stops at `docs/`)

**Decisions:**
- ADR-039: a chain overrides each section ID once, and specialises through a
  new ID at each level

**Lessons:**
- Three PRs each raised chain ceilings and each rebase conflicted on
  `tests/chain-budget.txt`. Resolving it by reading is wrong twice: the
  numbers are generated, and a branch's raises were measured against a tree
  that no longer exists. On the first one `git checkout --theirs` took the
  commit being applied rather than the upstream file — the inversion cost a
  recovery from the stash. The recipe is now in PLAYBOOK
- The cut raised 37 ceilings by 2,433 characters and 2,360 of that was a
  shipped check's Python, not a rule. Every consumer carries it in context on
  every turn and only CI executes it. Recorded on the chain-ceiling spike,
  because it may be the larger half of the question that spike asks
- A rule shipped with a corpus boundary leaves the outside ungated, and the
  outside is where the drift already is. The check written this session
  passes on `docs/` and leaves ten stale figures in `tests/specs/`, one of
  them matching no count in the tree
- Writing a template check through a shell heredoc turned `\b` into a literal
  backspace character inside the committed Markdown. Invisible in every
  rendering, and the regex silently stopped matching word boundaries

## 2026-09-06 — The fix that landed on one enumerator, and the audit that found the other two

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `v2.80.0` released, finishing the milestone about the tools
measuring 17 of the 37 roots a project can pick. Four checks stopped walking
the filesystem or reporting one number where the model has two, and the README
started naming the twenty roots it never named. The 360 audit the cut owed was
run rather than dispositioned, and three of its findings are defects in this
session's own work.

The session began with a check failing on a tree that had no defect: `SYS-07`
walked into two scratch worktrees under gitignored `temp/` and reported their
copies of `docs/audits/*-360.md` as misplaced files. It now asks git what
belongs to the repository. The same defect turned out to be shipping to
consumers — `quality.md`'s comment-layout check read 17 Python files, seven of
them a vendored tree, and every one of its 86 findings named a third party's
code. That fix cost 789 characters on every chain, so all 37 ceilings moved in
the same commit.

`SYS-11`, `SYS-12` and `SYS-13` each resolved both kinds of root and printed
their sum. A single 37 reads the same whether it is 17 and 20 or 37 and 0,
which is the case ADR-035 asks the separation to catch. Controls confirmed each
count now moves alone: an added opt-in root took 20 to 21 with stacks fixed,
an added stack took 17 to 18 with opt-in fixed. `SYS-13` was not in the issue
and carried the same defect; fixing two of three would have left the third for
the next audit.

**The audit found three defects in this session.** The README root-model
section merged hours earlier claimed an extra is one file plus the core tier;
ten of the twenty opt-in roots exceed that, `backend-webhooks` by five. Nothing
caught it because the counts were prose outside the generated blocks —
rewriting "20 orthogonal templates" to "99" passed `sync --check` and smoke
alike. It is generated now, and that control fails. Second, the ceiling raise
was 86% of the only reduction ever made to `chain-budget.txt`, undone inside
twenty-four hours; the raise was honest and the ratchet is what only prices
growth. Third, the enumeration fix landed on one check while
`all_template_files()` and `run_conformance.py` kept walking the disk — and the
first defines the corpus for six authoring checks, so a planted template with a
duplicate section ID shipped past all five gates green while the printed counts
sat unmoved at 74 files and 366 IDs.

**A `git add -A` published the user's unreviewed work.** Their parallel session
was editing `docs/design/design-notes.md`; the sweep took 97 lines of it into
PR #1522, which merged under a commit describing only README work. They
accepted it after the fact and asked for the remainder committed too, which
`#1523` did. The rule not to stage with `-A` here is now in memory rather than
in this repository, because it is about how the agent works and not about the
templates.

**Pull requests merged:** #1516, #1517, #1519, #1521, #1522, #1523, #1529 (the
cut), and the wrap-up's own.
**Issues closed:** #1515, #1465, #1520, #1471, #1353, #1506 in `v2.80.0`,
joining #1464 and #1466 already closed. #1353 and #1506 were found unmilestoned
by the milestone-coverage gate and assigned during the cut.
**Issues opened:** #1525 (P1, three enumerators still walk the disk), #1526,
#1527 and #1528 from the audit; #1530 as template feedback. #1518 was the
parallel session's and was labelled in passing.
**Upstream:** one pattern filed as #1530 — a figure a document states about the
tree is not gated unless a generator writes it. Both instances this session met
are the same shape: a count in README prose that no gate read, and a corpus
count that could not move because the enumerator never looked.
**Milestones:** #86 (`v2.80`) closed at 10/10.
**Audit:** `docs/audits/2026-09-06-360.md`. Seven context-isolated reviewers,
headless adaptation. Overall D+, down from C-: Authoring B+, Documentation B+,
Value B, Architecture B-, Testing B-, Viability C, Discovery D+. Two rose, one
held, four fell — none by regression in the tree; each fell on measuring
something the prior pass asserted. Discovery's clone figure was checked further
after the fan-out: the 2,438 clones against 76 views track workflow runs almost
exactly, four to six per run, so the traffic is this project's own CI rather
than bots or adopters.
**Owed and not repaired:** the audit's four open findings, of which #1525 is
P1 and unmilestoned because no next cut is scoped. The Documentation
dimension's smaller staleness — ONBOARDING's PyYAML count, the CHANGELOG
preamble's version range, CONTRIBUTING's missing width exemption, and `py`
versus `python3` in three contributor documents — is recorded in the audit and
not filed. `CLAUDE.md`'s test inventory was the one repaired here.
**State at close:** smoke 29/29, sync clean, `resolve.py --check` clean,
redundancy 0 exact, conformance 14 passed and 0 failed, 0 open pull requests,
no stale branches, label conformance `[]`, 74 open issues. `v2.80.0` is tagged,
published and verified.

## 2026-09-06 — Every gate was green over the defect

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `v2.82.0` released against a milestone scoped from a single
shape — twelve defects that each passed a check able to catch them. The
scope grew mid-groom: the first cut listed six issues, and the user asked
for every open bug, which brought the count to twelve and the theme with it.
Every open bug in the tracker is now closed.

The root defect was that a shipped check had no way to say it had found
something. `base-quality` now requires a check to carry its verdict in its
exit status, and requires a pass condition satisfied by the absence of
output to reach a non-zero one. Five `base-git` checks printed findings and
exited zero; they exit now. Two conformance dispositions were judgements
over pass conditions that decide, and the runner had no vocabulary for a
check that mixes a verdict with a reading, so the only disposition that did
not produce a false failure was the one producing no verdict at all. `READ`
is that vocabulary.

**Giving a check a real verdict is how its own defects surface.** The
commit's-checks check counted workflow runs for `git rev-parse HEAD`; on a
pull-request checkout that is the merge commit the host synthesises, never
pushed, so the count was zero for every pull request ever run. It had been
reporting that zero as a reading nobody scored. The first guard written for
it passed anyway — the host also leaves a remote-tracking ref pointing at
the merge commit, so an unscoped `git branch -r --contains HEAD` finds that
ref and reports the commit as carried. Both were found by CI failing on a
branch that passed locally, and both were controlled against a reproduced
pull-request checkout rather than reasoned about.

**A control that reads the wrong input is indistinguishable from a check
that holds.** The release-documentation check reads the record from `HEAD`.
Planting an undocumented capability in the working tree left its input
untouched, and the run came back byte-identical to the clean one — the
strongest thing a control can look like and the weakest thing it can be. It
only fired once the plant was committed. `CLAUDE.md` gained that rule; the
three control rules beside it each came from a different session, and this
is the fourth way the same reading has been wrong.

**The chain ceiling was removed at the user's instruction, and the history
agreed.** Over 32 commits touching `tests/chain-budget.txt`, a ceiling moved
up 702 times and down 37, every raise made by the author of the addition
that caused it, none refused. A gate whose remedy is to write the new number
into the file records rather than refuses. It also conflicted on four
branches in this release alone, each resolved by taking the upstream file
whole and re-measuring, which produced nothing at any of them. ADR-041
supersedes ADR-036; `README.md`'s model-limits table, already gated by
`sync --check`, is what still states the cost.

**The size figure that does bind moved during the cut.** The gated-figure
widening pushed the three library stacks from the 128K context tier to
200K — the chain had been sitting under that boundary by roughly 800
characters, so an ordinary core-tier rule crosses it. Nothing gates the
crossing; it appears only as a changed cell in a generated table. Filed as
#1551, which is the size question the ceiling's removal leaves open.

**This release's own theme arrived during its cut.** `platform-github`'s
changelog entry landed with its change and was deleted two pull requests
later, when the `Unreleased` section was consolidated by hand after a merge
conflict and one bullet did not survive the retyping. The
changelog-completeness check ran on that tree and exited 0, correctly: six
entries against fourteen carried commits is a legitimate reading, because a
commit touching no template earns no entry, and nothing separates that from
an entry someone removed. Restored in the cut, filed as #1560.

#1398 fixes in this release. Recorded in #1559 and left as it stands: the
milestone records what was planned and the tag records the tree, and
rewriting the first to tidy the second would misstate it.

`[]`, 65 open issues. The conformance run reports 0 readings against 3
budgeted because HEAD is the tag and the branch-scoped checks answer that
they do not apply. `v2.82.0` is tagged, published and verified.

## 2026-09-07 — Everything needed to catch it was already in the tree

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:** `v2.83.0` released, from a milestone scoped this session out
of the unmilestoned backlog. Six defects, one shape: the fact needed to
catch each was already computed, printed, recorded or registered somewhere
in the tree, and nothing connected it to a verdict. The manifest already
classified every stack by layer and no check asked whether a stack serving
traffic carried the security tier. The deleted changelog bullet was in
`CHANGELOG.md`'s own history and nothing looked back one tree. The context
tier was computed into the README on every sync and nothing failed on it.
The release gates were written, registered and never invoked.

Three of the six turned up a second defect while being built, each in the
control rather than the check. The changelog-deletion check compared a
former bullet against the whole file, which is what keeps a release cut
quiet — and this repository already carried an entry reading `base-git`
gains a changelog-completeness check, which shares 64% of its content
words with the entry the control deleted. The control reported clean over
a missing entry. The comparison now reaches only where a cut could have
carried the bullet: the current `Unreleased` section, and any version
section whose heading did not yet exist when the bullet was recorded.

The release gates were worse. Each resolves the release it follows with the
newest reachable tag, which on the release commit is the previous release
and at the tag itself is the tag being released. A naive tag-push trigger
would have run four gates over an empty range — measured at `v2.82.0`, the
baseline moves from `v2.82.0` to `v2.81.0` and the range from 0 commits to
15. Shipping that would have been this milestone's own defect, at the
moment it was being removed.

The third was a plant that landed in the file and outside the construct:
a non-existent path appended after the closing `]` of a `[DEPENDS ON: ...]`
directive. `git diff --stat` confirmed one insertion, the parser never saw
it, and smoke reported 29 checks and 0 failed — indistinguishable from the
check being absent. A fourth, in the same pull request, asserted only that
some manifest entry now held the planted value; `backend-api` already did.

The cut then failed its own release-documentation gate, which shipped in
`v2.82.0` and had never fired: the record named `quality-exemption-doc-duty`
and no document a consumer reads did. And the release-gates workflow
validated itself on the first release it could — it resolved `v2.83.0`
and its milestone from the tag, and the four gates produced real verdicts
where a routine push reports six not-applicable.

Three open issues were corrected rather than implemented. #1551 argued its
case against `tests/chain-budget.txt` and SYS-12, both deleted by ADR-041 the
day before; #1480 and #1511 carried acceptance criteria pointing at a
ceiling re-base that can no longer happen. Each gained a dated correction
naming what replaced it. #1551's defect survived its premise intact, and
ADR-041's own alternatives had already named the check as the better
instrument.

**PRs merged:** #1564, #1566, #1567, #1568, #1569, #1570, #1573, #1575

**Issues closed:** #1561, #1548, #1560, #1544, #1551, #1468

**Issues created:** #1565 (two smoke checks name spec files that do not
exist), #1574 (seven control rules govern this repository and one ships)

**Decisions:**
- ADR-042: a tag push runs the release gates, with the version from the
  tag and the milestone from its `v<major>.<minor>` prefix; the gates keep
  their hand-set constants, and a gate resolves the release it follows
  from the commit under release

**Lessons:**
- A control's landing assertion is the weakest link in the control.
  Asserting that the planted value is present somewhere passes when a
  sibling already carried it, so it holds whether or not the edit landed.
  Name the entity and compare before and after. Now in `CLAUDE.md` §6.2
- A check comparing text against a large corpus can be defeated by a
  look-alike the corpus already contains, and the control is what exposes
  it. Bounding the corpus to where the value could legitimately have gone
  fixed it; raising the similarity threshold would have hidden it again
- Three of the four parameterised release gates had never executed, so the
  baseline defect could not have been found by reading them. It appeared
  in the first minute they ran. A check that never runs is not merely
  unenforced — it is unverified
- The wrap-up audit filed #1574 and merged #1575, neither of which the
  release cut could have named. The ordering that puts the journal last
  held: this entry names both

## 2026-09-07 — Retiring a freeze, and four detectors blind to their subject

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

Groomed the backlog and cut `v2.84.0`. The groom found one clean unblocked
cluster in 41 unmilestoned issues: six tickets, all against
`quality-gates-retrofit-ratchet`, all measured on the same downstream
migration, saying the same thing from six angles — the section says how to
build a per-file freeze and nothing about how to retire one. Two of the six
were the same rule filed twice on the same day from different snapshots, so
#1556 closed into #1572 with its measurement carried across.

The rest of the backlog is gated on #1480. Nine issues reference it, five are
hard trigger-blocked, and the reason applies to any new rule in `base/core` or
`base/workflow` — the spike decides where those sections live. The freeze
cluster was pickable precisely because it lands on the KEEP side of that split:
the ratchet is the invariant gate model, not this project's operating
discipline.

Five pull requests, one concern each, in the order a slice actually runs:
the corpus-narrowing shape for gates with no per-file ignore (#1518), the
retirement order for caller-raised findings (#1572), an entry outliving its
findings (#1563), sizing a rule family without a destructive edit (#1406),
and the control a behaviour-changing slice owes (#1571).

**The release gate refused the cut**, correctly. A minor release owes a current
periodic review and the newest record was a day old. The alternative on offer
was to call `v2.84.0` a patch, which would have been a finding cleared by
changing the gate's input — the exact antipattern three of the five pull
requests in this release are about. Ran the audit instead.

Seven isolated reviewers. Overall **D**, down from D+, and the reason matters
more than the grade: three of the four dimensions that fell measured something
a prior pass had asserted rather than tested. Nothing degraded overnight; the
instruments improved.

Four detectors were found blind in one day, each certifying its own subject:

- ADR-031's check matches its phrase and its command on one line, and
  `CLAUDE.md` §2.7 mandates wrapping at 88 characters. Joining three lines of
  `go-lib.md` with no other edit moved the count 0 to 1. Two rules, each
  correct, combining into a blind spot (#1584)
- The conformance runner's `SILENT` verdict scores a check by printing
  nothing, so one pointed at a glob matching no files passed — ADR-034's case
  arriving through the disposition vocabulary instead of a check's output
  (#1585)
- `iter_blocks` documents itself as counting every language and skips untagged
  fences. Re-measured against a stateful parse: 54 of 150 blocks invisible,
  not the two the issue named (#1582)
- `base-docs` ships the rule that a stated figure comes from a generator, and
  a check for it that passed all week over two violations. Its regex wants a
  digit next to a bare noun; the tree had `Eight files` and `14
  manifest-reading checks`. A three-way control at the wrap-up settled it —
  spelled-out numeral 0, digit-plus-adjective 0, digit-plus-noun 1 (#1591)

The specification also states an absolute that 43 `[DEPENDS ON]` directives
contradict, and lists `review` in two tiers at once (#1587).

**PRs merged:** #1577, #1579, #1580, #1581, #1583, #1589, #1590

**Issues closed:** #1518, #1572, #1563, #1406, #1571, #1556 (duplicate)

**Issues created:** #1578 (length-bound exemptions, split out of #1518),
#1582 (untagged fences leave the conformance corpus), #1584 (the ADR-031
detector reads one line), #1585 (a SILENT disposition certifies no input),
#1586 (a skip reason is ungated and one is stale), #1587 (SPEC's core-tier
absolute), #1588 (nothing states which stacks carry a rule family),
#1591 (the documentation-figure check misses both shipped forms)

**Decisions:**
- No ADR. The five rules are content inside an existing section with no
  architectural alternative weighed, and the audit's findings are open
  questions rather than settled choices. Recording the absence because the
  wrap-up asks the question and a deliberate no is not the same as a skip

**Lessons:**
- A branch inserting at the same anchor as a merged sibling conflicts on
  every generated file. Resolving by taking main's version whole and
  re-applying the branch's block after it — rather than rebasing — kept the
  no-force-push rule and made the ordering explicit in the merge commit
- A gate refusing a release is the cheapest moment to discover the release is
  wrong. The audit it forced produced five issues and cost more than the cut
  it was gating, which is the correct ratio for a gate nobody wants to run
- The user asked why the templates are degrading. They are not: measured
  `v2.83.0..v2.84.0` at +3.4 KB on all 37 chains, +0.94% in one release, and
  `v2.60.0..v2.84.0` at 26 modified, 0 added, 0 deleted. Quality is flat and
  density is falling, because the work is generated by this repository's own
  operating experience — which lands in the always-loaded waist — while
  nothing prices growth and deletion is not an available move. #1480 already
  names it and sizes the remedy at 44%

## 2026-09-07 — Six checks that certified what they could not observe

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

Cut `v2.85.0`. The scope wrote itself: six open bugs, four of them filed by
yesterday's 360 audit that graded the repository D, and all six the same
shape — a check that passed over the thing it exists to find.

Two of the six were one class inside that shape, and it is the interesting
one. The ADR-031 detector matched its verification phrase and its command on
the same line; this repository wraps prose at 88 characters, so a check
written inline puts the phrase on one line and the command on the next, and
each half reads as innocent. The figure check wanted a digit beside a bare
noun; prose style spells numerals under ten, so `Eight files` walked past it.
Neither rule was wrong. Each detector was written against one rendering of
what it forbids, and the project's own style guide produces another. The
style guide is the adversary, and it is a written one — which means the
control set can be enumerated rather than guessed. Filed as #1604.

Widening the ADR-031 detector surfaced eight checks stated in prose, none of
them visible before. Six moved into fences with dispositions, `review.md`
turned out to name no runnable command, and `git.md`'s pass condition had
drifted eleven lines from the fence it belongs beside. Widening the figure
detector surfaced four ungated figures, two of them in the specification
counting the core tier in prose. Both widenings cost a false-positive fight:
admitting spelled numerals from `two` turned 4 findings into 22, eighteen of
them ordinary quantifier prose, so the list starts at `five` and a function
word or a unit in the gap disqualifies the match.

The tooling three were cheaper and sharper. `iter_blocks` documented itself
as counting every language and guarded on a non-empty language tag, so 54 of
156 fences were invisible to the total the docstring says exists to catch a
filter that stops matching. `SILENT` scored a pass on printing nothing, which
is ADR-034's exact case arriving through the disposition vocabulary rather
than through a check's output; both `SILENT` entries now state their corpus
and the disposition is retired. And a skip reason was found describing a
placeholder workflow that had been shipping for weeks — the fix gives an
entry a `substitute` map so a check unrunnable only for naming a placeholder
runs instead of being skipped around, which turned the stale skip into a
passing check on its first run.

**PRs merged:** #1593, #1594, #1595, #1596, #1597, #1598, #1599, #1600, #1603

**Issues closed:** #1584, #1591, #1582, #1585, #1586, #1587

**Issues created:** #1604 (a prose detector is not tested against the forms
the project's own style rules produce)

**Decisions:**
- ADR-043 — declaring a core-tier file is redundant, not forbidden. The
  specification said no directive anywhere declares one, which the tree
  contradicts 43 times across 19 templates; correcting it required deciding
  what those declarations mean, and the alternative was sweeping all 43 and
  gating against their return. Rejected: the resolver has always
  deduplicated them, the sweep would reorder every resolved chain, and the
  directive documents a dependency a reader would otherwise infer

**Lessons:**
- A control must mutate the check's INPUT, never the string its disposition
  uses to find it. Emptying the CRLF check's corpus by editing its extension
  list — which is also its `find` string — stopped the registry locating the
  block, and the run reported drift between the registry and the templates.
  A different defect, in a different file, saying nothing about the check.
  Landed in the PLAYBOOK (#1603); it ships nowhere, which is #1574's subject
- The release procedure said to set `MILESTONE` and the gate reads
  `RELEASE_MILESTONE`. Setting the constant's name leaves it reporting that
  the release is not scoped to a milestone, which is the one answer
  indistinguishable from a clean pass. Also #1603
- Widening a detector is not free and the cost is measurable before shipping.
  Both widenings here were tuned against the whole corpus first, and in both
  cases the obvious widening the issue proposed was too loose — two or three
  intervening words matched arbitrary prose, and spelled numerals from `two`
  matched five times more noise than signal

## 2026-09-07 — The ADR threshold, and the copies that outlived it

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Replaced the ADR trigger in `base-docs`. It read "a consequential,
  durable architectural choice with meaningful alternatives", which #1506
  installed in August; it is a judgement, and every routine decision can be
  argued past it. It now reads as an observation: a record is owed when the
  decision changes something a user of the thing sees without reading the
  repository's internals
- Corrected the same trigger in `base-ai-workflow` tier 2, `base-scope`
  item 4, `CLAUDE.md` section 2.9 and the PLAYBOOK's `Author a new ADR`
  and `Adopt a template policy update`
- Regenerated all seven `examples/*/CLAUDE.md` audit sections against the
  current chain, per ADR-016

**PRs merged:** #1607 (the rule), #1608 (PLAYBOOK), #1609 (`base-scope`),
#1610 (the seven examples)

**Issues closed:** #1606, #1220

**Issues created:** #1606 (the threshold is qualitative, so routine
decisions argue past it)

**Decisions:**
- No ADR. `base-docs` resolves into every chain, so a consuming project
  does observe this rule change — but the test names the composition
  model, not the content of any one rule among hundreds. If every template
  rule change qualified, the explosion the change exists to stop returns.
  #1607's body reached the same conclusion by a weaker argument, that a
  consumer does not observe it at all, which is not true

**Lessons:**
- The measurement that made the case came from the consumer, not from
  here. `Imbra-Ltd/pyomb` holds 51 records written across 21 days — 16 on
  prose style and document form, 11 on naming and layout, 9 on tool
  choice, 4 on the release procedure, and two on how to decide. This
  repository's own 44 look defensible one at a time; pyomb's 51 do not
  look defensible at all, and they are generated by the same rule
- The mechanical gate that suggested itself does not port. Scoping the
  trigger to in-scope `category:` values needs those values named, and
  pyomb's are `protocol` and `repository` while this repository's are
  `composition` and `templates`. A shared template cannot name either set,
  so the test has to carry itself
- A sweep for a rule's wording finds its copies, not its restatements.
  Grepping `consequential, durable` cleared four files and left
  `base-scope` item 4 untouched, because it paraphrased the trigger in its
  own words while pointing at the file it contradicted. It surfaced only
  when the example regeneration needed the canonical checklist to copy from
- Regenerating an example is worth more than the drift that prompts it.
  #1220 tracked one defect, the journal at position 4. The regeneration
  found four more frozen items, and found that `hybrid-astro` hard-delegated
  to the chain's audit and then appended a nine-item paraphrase of it —
  which `agents.md` forbids in terms. The delegation above read as current
  while the paraphrase below held every stale item

---

## 2026-09-07 — Rule parity between what the repository applies and what it ships

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Shipped three negative-control rules from `CLAUDE.md` section 6.2 into
  `base-quality-gates`: a control forces the path under test to run, its
  landing assertion names the entity it mutated and compares that entity's
  value on both sides, and the tree is staged before a control mutates it
- Added `testing-detector-style-forms` — a detector whose corpus is prose
  is controlled against the renderings the project's own style rules
  produce, not only the one its author had in mind
- Added `testing-suite-precondition-refusal` — a suite whose own
  precondition is absent refuses the run and names the missing thing once,
  rather than reporting a dependency gap as N findings about the tree
- Stated the module-split rule's precondition: the untouched-suite oracle
  certifies a move, a seam running through a class is a design change to
  sequence before the split, and a suite reading module identity breaks by
  examining an empty set
- Added an eighth shape to issue verification — a cited version identifier
  that still resolves and is no longer current
- Extended the closing-keyword rule to cover quoting it, and added
  `quality-gates-length-bound-exemptions`
- Added SYS-17 (every registered check names a spec document that exists
  and is indexed) and wrote the three specs it found missing
- Reports are named for the tree they measured, not only the minute
- Added SYS-18 and ADR-044: the quality-gate tier's membership is declared
  by stack category, and `stack-express`, `stack-nestjs` and
  `stack-nodejs-lib` now resolve it
- Recorded both governed tiers in `docs/SPEC.md`, which documented the
  composition model and had never carried either membership policy

**PRs merged:** #1612 (controls), #1613 (prose detector), #1614 (suite
precondition), #1615 (split oracle), #1616 (superseded citation), #1617
(closing keyword), #1618 (length bound), #1619 (spec references), #1620
(report names the tree), #1621 (tier membership), #1622 (SPEC)

**Issues closed:** #1574, #1493, #1604, #1494, #986, #1602, #1215, #1601,
#1578, #1565, #1417, #1588

**Issues created:** #1623 (a single-commit pull request loses the issue
number the convention puts in its subject)

**Decisions:**
- ADR-044. Declaring which stacks carry a rule family changes what a chain
  resolves, which is what the observability threshold asks for. The other
  ten pull requests added rules to files their chains already carried and
  owed no record
- The quality-gate tier admits the three stacks that fit and exempts the
  two that do not, with the context tier as the recorded reason. Adding it
  costs 81K characters: `stack-htmx` reaches 416K and `stack-c-embedded`
  392K against the 385K a 128K window leaves, so admitting them would
  change which models can run those stacks

**Lessons:**
- A filed issue's premise can be wrong rather than stale. #1574 tabulated
  six of seven control rules as unshipped; four already shipped, and both
  templates carrying three of them predate the v2.83.0 measurement the
  issue states. Re-measuring first cut the work in half and moved one row
  to the issue that argued it better
- The gate shipped two hours earlier caught the change that followed it.
  SYS-17 failed SYS-18 for having no spec document, which is the whole
  claim of the check that a registry can name a document nobody wrote
- A control on this repository's own suite is cheap and it moved. Every
  control this session asserted its mutation landed by naming the entity
  and reading its value on both sides — spec documents 58 to 57, index
  rows 1 to 0, a `depends_on` count 1 to 0 — which is the rule shipped in
  the session's first pull request, applied to the rest of it
- The audit found what the work did not. Item 8 asked whether a
  composition-model change is reflected in the specification; the answer
  was no for the new tier and no for the security tier that has been
  enforced since it shipped

---

## 2026-09-07 — The review that was paced by the release, not by the project

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- Re-paced the periodic project-wide review: the obligation is decided by
  the age of the newest record against a declared interval, defaulting to
  ninety days, rather than by whether the release moves the minor or major
  version. A release whose record is current owes nothing whatever version
  it moves; a release whose record is stale owes a review whatever version
  it moves
- Rewrote `base-git`'s `periodic-review-scope` check accordingly. It reads
  no release version, so it runs in this repository rather than reporting
  as not applicable, and it exempts a project with no audit directory
  while treating an empty one as a project that owes a review and wrote
  none
- `360-when` dropped its quarterly bullet and now defers to the interval
  declared beside the check
- Generalised the currency-gate section above it: the non-strict
  comparison is against the day being compared to, not specifically the
  previous release

**Released:** v2.86.0 — tag `a085962` on the changelog cut, milestone #92
closed at 15/15, release-gates green on the tag push.

**Pull requests merged:** #1626 (#1625), #1627 (the v2.86.0 changelog cut).

**Issues closed:** #1625. **Issues filed:** #1628.

**Decisions:**
- ADR-045 supersedes ADR-033. The earlier record rejected a calendar
  cadence because it decouples the review from the changes it reads — a
  quiet quarter would owe one and a busy one might not. The first half
  holds and the second does not survive the on-demand triggers staying in
  force: a busy period reaches an audit through a milestone or a major
  feature long before an interval expires, so the interval only ever
  decides the quiet case, which is the case a cadence is for
- The interval is declared beside the check rather than beside the events
  that trigger a review. `resolve.py` puts `core/git.md` in 37 of 37 roots
  and `workflow/360.md` in 1, so stating the figure in the audit template
  would have given 36 projects a check enforcing an interval and no line
  declaring one

**Lessons:**
- The narrowing that fixed a gate can reproduce it one level up. Scoping
  the review to minor and major releases removed the patch case and left
  the frequency coupling intact, so a repository cutting a minor most days
  wrote six whole-project reviews, four of them inside a week
- A range match that never finds its end marker runs to the end of the
  file and reports a plausible number. `awk` from `## [Unreleased]` to
  `## [v2.85` counted 112 changelog entries because the heading in the
  file is `## [2.85.0]`, with no `v`. The true figure was 11, and nothing
  in the output said the range was open
- The release-documentation gate reads `git show HEAD:`, so the changelog
  cut had to be committed before it would pass. The rule was already in
  `CLAUDE.md` section 6.2 and the run still cost one confused re-read
- A gate that has already scanned its corpus should report every finding.
  Milestone-coverage named one unmilestoned issue per run, so three
  offenders cost three runs and the scale of the problem was visible only
  after it was fixed (#1628)

---

## 2026-09-07 — A result that reports less than the run knows

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- A check that has read its whole corpus now reports every finding before
  it exits. `base-examples`' smoke runner was the one shipped check
  breaching that: it stopped at the first failing example, so a project
  with four broken examples learned of them in four runs. It counts
  failures and exits once
- An exemption is a holding position, not an outcome. Where an example was
  exempted because it needs a peer, the runnable demonstration moves into
  the examples directory and the exemption retires in the same change;
  the docstring then names the example rather than carrying a shortened
  copy of it
- A branch updated from `main` re-derives nothing, so the regeneration and
  its staleness comparison are owed again after the update. Git reports
  the branch `MERGEABLE` throughout, because the two changes fall in
  different regions of the same files, and a suite that does not read the
  generated directory passes on the stale artifact
- A single-commit branch names in its commit subject the issues its pull
  request closes, with a check asserting it before the merge. The host
  squashes using the pull request title only from two commits up, so a
  number living only in the title never reaches `main`

**Released:** v2.87.0 — tag `ba8ff59` on the changelog cut, milestone #93
closed 5/5.

**Pull requests merged:** #1630 (#1628), #1631 (#1408), #1632 (#1249),
#1633 (#1623), #1635 (#1634), #1637 (the v2.87.0 changelog cut), #1639
(the CLAUDE.md carve-out).

**Issues closed:** #1628, #1408, #1249, #1623, #1634. **Issues filed:**
#1634, #1638.

**Decisions:**
- No ADR. Four rules were added to templates and none of them changes what
  a consuming project can observe without reading this repository — the
  composition model, the ID system and the inheritance rules are untouched
- The rule about reporting every finding went to `base-quality-gates`
  rather than `base-examples`, measured: `resolve.py` puts quality-gates
  in 18 roots of 37 and examples in 11, and every chain carrying examples
  carries quality-gates, so the cross-reference does not dangle
- The milestone-coverage instance #1628 named was dropped rather than
  fixed. The check accumulates findings and reaches a single exit, at
  `v2.85.0` as well as on `main`, so the one-finding-per-run behaviour
  observed during the v2.86 cut had another cause

**Lessons:**
- A check controlled where it was written can ship into an environment
  that answers differently. The single-commit check passed four local
  negative controls and then reported "not applicable" in CI on the very
  branch that introduced it, because a `pull_request` checkout is a merge
  commit whose local range holds one commit more than the branch does.
  The first run in the target environment was the run that disproved it,
  and it read as a green pipeline. Filed as #1638
- A rule shipped without its exception fails on the repository's own
  routine work within the hour. The single-commit rule blocked this
  session's changelog cut, which closes no issue and therefore has no
  number to name — caught only because the check ran against the cut
  before the tag
- The groom is where a stale issue is caught, not the implementation. Of
  the four issues scoped, one named an instance that had never held; the
  measurement took a minute and would have cost a wrong fix to a correct
  check

## 2026-09-08 — The rule this repository follows and does not require

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- A check reading the change under review is confirmed in the environment
  it ships into, and that run has to reach a verdict. A pull-request event
  hands the check a merge commit, a detached HEAD, possibly a shallow
  clone, and a branch name that survives only in a variable; a check
  declining on the very change it was written for hides in a green
  pipeline because a decline summons no reader
- The backlog groom and the merged-work sweep, carried only in this
  repository's PLAYBOOK, ship upstream. The groom goes to `base-issues`
  and the sweep to `base-git` as step 9 of the release sequence, where the
  gate it complements already lives
- A ticket, a pull request and a defect record are written for a reader
  without the code in their head: symptom before mechanism, a code term
  expanded on first use, the example shown rather than described
- A decision record's prose stays within sentence and paragraph bounds the
  project declares in configuration. Forty-two existing passages across 18
  of 45 records are frozen and the check gates what is written after
- A rename of a document other repositories carry is proposed against a
  measured, dated downstream, with a control path that must be absent
- Thirteen shipped checks printed what they found and exited zero. Each
  now carries its verdict in its status
- The single-commit subject check read `messageHeadline`, which the host
  abbreviates at 69 characters while the convention allows 79

**Released:** v2.88.0 — tag `c4933ef` on the changelog cut, milestone #94
closed 7/7. The first cut to run the merged-work sweep, which found none.

**Pull requests merged:** #1641 (#1638), #1642 (#1248), #1644 (#1643),
#1645 (#1301), #1647 (#1646), #1649 (#1082), #1650 (#1295), #1651 (the
PLAYBOOK gate-status correction), #1652 (the v2.88.0 changelog cut), #1653
(the CLAUDE.md conformance rule).

**Issues closed:** #1638, #1248, #1301, #1643, #1646, #1082, #1295.
**Issues filed:** #1643, #1646, #1648, #1654.

**Decisions:**
- No ADR. Every decision applies an existing record — ADR-028 for siting by
  reach, the retrofit ratchet for the prose freeze, `base-quality`'s
  exit-status rule for the thirteen checks — or falls in the categories the
  observability threshold excludes
- The groom went to `base-issues` (3 roots of 37) and the sweep to
  `base-git` (37 of 37), measured. `base-issues` is a platform-tier file, so
  the tracker procedure reaches exactly the projects with a tracker to
  groom; the sweep's finding is a release-gate blind spot and belongs where
  every root carries it
- The cold-reader prose rules went to `base-docs` rather than `base-issues`
  as filed, for the same reason: a pull request body and a defect record
  have the same reader as a ticket, and none of the five rules mentions a
  tracker
- The ADR prose bound is frozen rather than retrofitted. Forty-two prose
  edits to merged records inside the change declaring the bound would have
  been unreviewable, and each needs its own word-level diff as evidence
- Two of the thirteen exit-status fixes are deliberately not uniform. The
  continuation-safety check keeps exit 0 on its findings because its
  disposition declares them a reading, and the SBOM check prints its
  components as a reading and fails only on the empty set

**Lessons:**
- The rule shipped first earned itself twice within the hour. #1641 added
  "confirm the check where it ships"; the next pull request went red on two
  checks every local control had passed — a field the host truncates, and a
  sweep reading the pull-request merge commit, whose log holds the branch's
  own unmerged commit and so reported the branch's issue as merged work
- A rule can ship with its corpus unswept and stay green over its own
  violations for six releases. `base-quality` has required a check to carry
  its verdict in its status since v2.82; that change fixed five checks in
  one file and thirteen others were never read. Filed as #1654
- Smoke and conformance read different things. Replacing a sentence that
  ended mid-line left the rest of its paragraph appended rather than
  re-wrapped, put a 127-character line into every generated chain and
  produced 36 findings, with smoke green over all of it. The run before
  pushing was smoke only. `CLAUDE.md` 6.2 now says which runner reads what
- A check's locator is shared state. The prose-bound check prints
  "decision records inspected", which was the string the ADR-schema entry
  used to find its own block, and the registry reported two blocks for one
  entry rather than silently running the wrong one
- The freeze has to name instances. A frozen count lets one breach be
  swapped for another and reads as compliance, and an entry whose passage
  was since rewritten has to be reported too, or it licenses a breach that
  nothing would notice coming back

## 2026-09-11 — The claim a rule rests on, re-measured against what it governs

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context)

**Key changes:**
- A change adding a constraint sweeps the corpus it already governs and
  records what the sweep covered, what it found and what it left out. A
  corpus that does not comply is fixed or frozen by named instance, and an
  immutable one names the boundary the rule binds forward from
- A cut whose changelog section holds only Fixed or Security entries is a
  patch. The release-documentation check reads the bump against the
  highest release tag below the version, and the release-gates workflow
  resolves a milestone naming the full version before the minor line. The
  case for pacing a periodic review by the calendar no longer opens on
  patches being common, which was false here at every one of 90 tags
- A format-only split of a merged decision record may re-case the word
  that opens the new sentence and drop the "and" of a series turned into a
  list, and the prose check splits at a quotation mark and after closing
  bold
- The 42 frozen decision-record passages are cleared, one by the splitter
  fix and 41 split in place across five pull requests, and
  `docs/decisions/prose-freeze.txt` is deleted. Its conformance slots now
  require zero frozen
- The e2e runner writes no report on a dry run and names mode, provider and
  model on a live one, and its Anthropic backend streams against a current
  model. The PLAYBOOK and `CLAUDE.md` state the cadence: the STK-15 canary
  live at every cut, the full suite at each periodic review
- `CLAUDE.md` 2.1 says a subject names only the issue its pull request
  closes, and ONBOARDING names the provider key a live e2e run needs

**Released:** v2.89.0 — tag on the changelog cut `45054ac`, milestone #95
closed 6/6. The first cut to run the patch-rule check, which read a minor
with four entries outside a fix heading, and the first to record a live
canary, which failed.

**Pull requests merged:** #1657 (#1654), #1658 (#1469), #1662 (#1659),
#1664 (#1660), #1666, #1671, #1672 and #1673 (parts of #1648), #1670 (the
e2e runner, part of #1368), #1674 (#1368), #1675 (#1648), #1677 (the
v2.89.0 changelog cut), #1678 (the `CLAUDE.md` subject rule), #1679 (the
ONBOARDING e2e prerequisite).

**Issues closed:** #1654, #1469, #1659, #1660, #1648, #1368.
**Issues filed:** #1659, #1660, #1661, #1668, #1669, #1676.

**Decisions:**
- No ADR. The patch rule is release procedure, which the observability
  threshold excludes, and ADR-006's "milestones map to minor bumps" stands
  as history
- Security counts as a fix heading beside Fixed. Keep a Changelog files a
  vulnerability fix there, and a Fixed-only rule would fail every
  adopter's security patch
- The freeze was retired by format-only splits rather than by reasoned
  exceptions. Four passages had no split at a stop that left both halves
  as sentences, and each became a list under the permission #1659 added
- The live e2e runs used Gemini, because the Anthropic account has no
  credits. Refusal fallbacks stay off in the Anthropic backend: a fallback
  model answering would make the report's Model line false
- The part pull requests of a split issue carried no issue number in the
  subject, because the merged-work sweep fails on every open issue a merged
  subject names
- Stashes were cleaned at the user's request: one live stash from
  2026-09-05, thirty files that apply to main in neither direction, and 99
  dropped stash commits, pruned with a one-hour window for the parallel
  session

**Lessons:**
- A control's landing assertion caught a wrong plant. The first
  patch-bump plant went under `## [Unreleased]` and absorbed the branch's
  own entries, and printing the planted section's headings showed three
  where one was planted
- A sweep reporting no change can have read nothing. The
  milestone-resolution sweep over 90 tags reported zero changes because
  `jq` is absent from this shell and both sides came back empty. The control
  that had to resolve came back empty too, which is what exposed it
- A live report embeds the templates' own text, and a check grepping the
  test root reads it. The class-attribute check failed locally after the
  e2e run, then kept failing on the conformance report that recorded the
  finding (#1669)
- The canary's output now reaches the output ceiling: `MAX_TOKENS` at
  62,937 output and 2,595 thinking tokens against 65,536. The Gemini
  backend graded the truncated text, which read as two different template
  failures on two runs of the same tree (#1676)
- An issue's premise can be a dry run. #1368 dated the last live e2e run
  2026-05-06; that report ran 27 cases in 0.1 seconds in the offline mode
  removed eleven minutes later, and the last live full suite was 2026-03-22

## 2026-09-11 — A check's input scope, measured against what its rule examines

**Tool:** Claude Code (Sonnet 5, launched via Fable 5.1)

**Key changes:**
- STK-22 now checks the numbered `Code conventions` heading the output
  shape actually produces, plus a C-specific content marker, instead of
  the stack template's own `C conventions` source heading — verified
  against ADR-017 and a real generated example before changing anything
- A project MAY declare a directional layering ban between tiers,
  distinct from the acyclic-dependency rule, with a named AST-walk check
- Where a type checker's override rule is frozen, the variadic ban names
  a contract test as its check: member kind, first parameter,
  append-only widening, no variadics, read via `inspect.getattr_static`
- The class-attribute and `sys.path`-in-tests checks scope their scan to
  tracked files (`git ls-files`/`git grep`), so a gitignored e2e report
  quoting the pattern is no longer a false finding
- The release-documentation check joins a wrapped changelog entry before
  reading it, so an identifier or code span on a continuation line is no
  longer invisible; 12 of 26 released sections would have read
  differently
- Every e2e provider backend now raises on a non-completion finish
  reason before assertions run, and returns token usage. The STK-15
  canary's live Gemini failure diagnosed as reasoning-token variance —
  96% of the ceiling spent on thinking, 4% on the answer — not ceiling
  size; disabling thinking for the verbatim-reproduction task dropped it
  to 11% of the ceiling with a verified-genuine, complete answer

**Released:** none. Milestone #96 "v2.90 — Check input scope and
coverage" closed 6/6; no tag cut in this pass.

**Pull requests merged:** #1681 (#1668), #1682 (#1667), #1683 (#1665),
#1684 (#1669), #1685 (#1661), #1686 (#1676).

**Issues closed:** #1668, #1667, #1665, #1669, #1661, #1676.
**Issues filed:** none — all six were groomed from the existing
unmilestoned backlog, not newly filed this session.

**Decisions:**
- No ADR. All six changes edit prose and check logic inside existing
  sections; none touch the composition model
- #1006 (a pre-commit hooks repo distributing this repo's own checks)
  moved to v3.0 rather than joining this milestone: shipping runtime
  code into a consumer's gate is a category change against the
  plain-Markdown stack, and owes an ADR before code, not a 2.x fix
- The live, costed Gemini call for #1676's canary measurement was
  confirmed with the user before spending — both the call itself and
  the all-6-merge-on-green execution mode were explicit choices, not
  assumed defaults

**Lessons:**
- A ceiling failure can be a variance problem, not a size problem. The
  same STK-15 prompt truncated at 96% thinking / 4% answer on one call
  and completed at 11% of the ceiling with thinking disabled — raising
  `MAX_TOKENS` would have papered over the variance rather than removed
  it
- Own error, caught before it reached `origin`: PR 6's first commit
  landed directly on `main` — the `checkout -b` step was skipped after
  five prior PRs' merge-checkout-pull-delete rhythm made branching feel
  automatic. `git reset --hard` is blocked by this environment's
  permission system even against `origin/main`; the recovery was
  branch-at-HEAD, delete `main`, recreate it tracking `origin/main` (see
  `lesson_branch_before_commit` in project memory)
- A milestone title reading as a full sentence reads as a marketing
  line even when every word is plain; the wanted register is a noun
  phrase naming the component and the property, matching the project's
  own older titles rather than its two most recent ones

## 2026-09-11 — A full backlog groom, cleared same session

**Released:** none.

**Pull requests merged:** #1689 (#1663), #1690 (#1656), #1691 (#976),
#1692 (#1524), #1693 (#1012), #1694 (#1007), #1696 (#727), #1697
(#1174), #1699 (#1695), #1700 (#1698).

**Issues closed:** #1663, #1656, #976, #1524, #1012, #1007, #727,
#1174, #1695, #1698 delivered; #711 and #179 closed duplicate; #308 and
#349 closed `wontdo`. #1184's stale blocker corrected and the issue
restored to v3.0 rather than closed — the external spike it named had
already concluded on 2026-08-28.

**Issues filed:** #1698, discovered while shipping #1174 — `sync.py`
measured its core-tier statement over `git ls-files`, which reads the
index, so a template added to the manifest and to disk in the same
change was undercounted until staged. Fixed same session.

**Decisions:**
- Every open issue was read start to finish before grooming: two
  resolved as duplicates of a better-evidenced issue (#711 → #1050,
  #179 → #712/#1480) rather than closed outright; two cross-linked
  instead of merged after a closer read showed they asked different
  questions than their apparent duplicate (#414 keeps skills-as-UX
  distinct from #712's skills-as-delivery; #562's templating-layer call
  feeds #1504's directory move rather than duplicating it)
- #727: `base-oop` promoted to the core tier (ADR-046) rather than wired
  into the three library stacks alone, after measuring that the
  narrower fix reached 13/17 and the two 128K-tier chains had headroom
  (htmx 374,121 → 378,272 chars, c-embedded 350,465 → 354,616)
- #1174: `c-embedded` given a stack-owned Quality gates section over
  extending `base-quality-gates`, after measuring that the embedded
  chain does not resolve that file and admitting it would cross the
  128K tier ADR-044 ties to a stated reason
- #305 held rather than shipped — the four doc items are ready, but the
  call was to leave the epic in v3.0 rather than land part of it early
- Every rule shipped carried a control: a throwaway package plant for
  the error-hierarchy check (#1007), a live `.clang-tidy`/`lizard`
  read before naming a complexity binding (#1174), a four-case run of
  the extracted lock-reader check (#1695), and a two-run byte-identity
  comparison for the sync fix (#1698)

**Lessons:**
- A blocker named in an issue body is a claim about the day it was
  filed, not a live fact. #1184 was demilestoned twice — 2026-09-03 and
  again by me — as blocked on an external spike that had already closed
  completed three days before my second read. Neither pass ran `gh
  issue view` on the external issue; both restated the body
- A tool that reads `git ls-files` for a set the caller already has
  from a working-tree file it parsed anyway is reading the wrong
  source twice. `sync.py` had `entries` in hand — built from
  `manifest.yaml` on disk — and walked the index for the same
  information, so a file that existed in both places by different
  means (one staged, one not) read as two different counts
- Reading a candidate tool's own `--help` output caught a wrong
  binding before it shipped: the issue offered `lizard` for cognitive
  complexity, and its extension list names cyclomatic and Halstead
  metrics but nothing cognitive — installing it and reading `--help`
  took under a minute and changed the binding to clang-tidy's
  `readability-function-cognitive-complexity`

## 2026-09-12 — A misfiled entry, the v3.0 fork model, a pre-registered benchmark

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, then Fable 5.1)

**Key changes:**
- `base-config` was registered under the manifest's `backend:` key while
  its file lives in `base/core/`; `sync.py` renders the SPEC tree from the
  key and the basename, so SPEC listed a `backend/config.md` that does not
  exist and omitted the real file. Re-keyed, and `sync.py` now refuses an
  entry filed outside its section's directory (#1702)
- `docs/design/efficacy-benchmark.md`: the pre-registered design for
  #1184 — one application (`tariff`, a pricing engine with a Flask + HTMX
  UI), three arms, paired trials under an isolated agent profile, a
  layered judge, a verdict rule fixed before any run, and the same
  harness as the benchmark a template trim is measured with (#1703)
- v3.0 planned with the owner, one question at a time, into
  `temp/docs/v3.0-plan.md` (untracked): the milestone is a contract
  freeze delivered as a fork model — `solid-ai-templates` keeps the
  engine and invariant policy, `imbra-ai-templates` forks it and adds
  stacks, platforms and the process layer

**Released:** none. `v2.90` stays closed and untagged (23 commits since
`v2.89.0`); the tag is the fork point and opens Phase 0.

**Pull requests merged:** #1702, #1703 (part of #1184).

**Issues closed:** none. **Issues filed:** none — the plan's new issues
(v2.90.0 cut, four ADRs, `resolve.py` diagnostics, manifest ownership
check, fork-sync CI job, fixtures, idiom fold, migration guide, v3.0.0
cut) and its groom are applied in the loop's first iteration, by the
owner's choice.

**Decisions:**
- Stable means contract freeze only: paths, IDs, manifest schema,
  declaration block, core membership and check exit codes are frozen from
  `3.0.0` to v4; prose changes freely in 3.x
- No compiler or CLI in v3.0; generation stays agent-driven and
  `resolve.py` gains named errors for a missing dependency and a cycle
- Forks and projects migrate on their own schedule against a migration
  guide; the break is communicated in a `Breaking changes` section and a
  compatibility-policy ADR
- Boundary by directory, every row settled: `backend/` and `frontend/`
  stay after a measured genericity check (0 MUST/SHOULD lines name a
  vendor across 21 files); `templating.md` goes to the fork as a UI
  concern; `language/` splits by content — idiom sections fold into core
  beside the generic rule they instantiate, every `## Tooling` section
  plus `go.md` and `c.md` go to the fork; a fixture stack and platform
  stay upstream so per-stack checks keep an input
- The single manifest is not a fork blocker: a fork appending under its
  own keys merges cleanly against upstream edits to `base:`; the rule is
  ownership by key, checked by smoke, with fragments as optional insurance
- The efficacy app is `tariff` over `logsift`, `flowkit`, `ledger` and
  `convert`: a domain model where OOP is the natural shape and two
  orthogonal extension axes make a missed Strategy visible; a frontend was
  added on request, server-rendered, because no Python web chain carries
  the frontend rules and an SPA half would get none

**Lessons:**
- A generator that prints a fixed heading and each entry's basename
  renders a misfiled entry at a path that does not exist, and `--check`
  stays green because regeneration reproduces the same wrong tree. The
  guard is to derive the directory from the path, or refuse when key and
  path disagree
- Pushback the owner asked for changed an outcome: `language/` was
  headed to the fork whole until the idiom sections were read and found
  tool-free; the split by content followed from the text, not the
  directory name
- The simulated fork merge was denied by the permission system, so the
  "merges cleanly" claim is reasoning about three-way merge, not a
  measurement — recorded as such, with the fork-sync CI job as the proof
- Brevity tripped twice on design answers; a "how does X work" question
  is not a document request and takes the six lines too

## 2026-09-12 — v2.90.0 cut, and a benchmark built before it is believed

**Tool:** Claude Code (Fable 5.1, then Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- `v2.90.0` released: the last 2.x, the v3.0 fork point, and the revision
  arm B of the efficacy benchmark is generated from. Milestone 96 closed,
  16 of 16. Ten closed issues whose fixes ship in it carried no milestone
  and were added during the cut, which is why the coverage gate reads 16
  and not 6
- The efficacy benchmark's every parameter fixed with the owner rather
  than by me: `claude-sonnet-5` generating through the CLI at effort high,
  `gpt-6-astra` judging through `codex exec`, arm C in, K = 3, the hidden
  suite private, Flask confirmed. I had settled the models unilaterally in
  an earlier pull request and the owner pulled it back (#1711)
- The hidden acceptance suite written and validated: 377 checks over 16
  modules for the build trial and 53 over two more for the change task,
  in the private `braboj/tariff-hidden-suite`
- Arm B's context file generated: 406 lines from one non-interactive
  invocation against the chain at `v2.90.0`, by a generator that reads the
  pinned brief out of the design so the arm matches its pre-registration
  (#1719, #1720)
- A review of the design found six live defects, fixed in #1717, and named
  a seventh already fixed

**Pull requests merged:** 16 — #1705, #1706, the cut #1708, #1709, #1710,
#1711 through #1721.

**Issues closed:** none. Every merged subject named a pull request; #1184
stays open because no trial has run, and carries a progress comment.

**Issues filed:** #1707 — the STK-15 canary is over the Gemini output
ceiling again, and a truncated run's token usage is dropped.

**ADRs:** none owed. The threshold is a decision a consuming project can
observe without reading this repository, and everything here was
measurement method, benchmark input, or this repository's own tooling.

**Lessons:**
- Building the grader and a reference implementation independently against
  one specification is what found the specification's faults. It named
  every route and method but no form field, so no POST could be issued and
  the suite could not be written at all; the fragment requirement and the
  works-without-JavaScript requirement contradicted each other, which
  surfaced only because two of my own tests could not both pass
- A suite that has only ever passed has not been shown to grade. Five
  planted specification violations, five caught, baseline green either
  side — and the suite carried one wrong assertion, found by its first run
  against a correct implementation
- The change task measured data entry. Buy-one-get-one is the existing
  bulk rule with `buy` 2 and `pay` 1, and a reduced category rate is a key
  in an existing rates table, so every arm would have scored perfect
  extensibility by typing two form rows
- The verdict rule contradicted its own worked example, reading
  overlapping raw numbers as inconclusive when every paired difference was
  positive. Fixing it honestly forced the admission that at K = 3 no
  arrangement of trials reaches significance, so the primary run's
  intervals are labelled descriptive
- A static tool pointed at a hard-coded `src` reports zero findings when
  it scanned nothing. This repository already ships the rule against that,
  from #1005; I wrote the design without applying my own project's rule to
  it
- Two harness defects invisible without running it: a bare `claude` in an
  argv list cannot launch on Windows, and the isolated home has no
  credentials while the CLI reports "Not logged in" as a *successful*
  result. Nine trials could have completed having never reached a model
- A text read-then-write round trip rewrites every line ending on Windows.
  It failed a mutation control's own restore assertion, and then I made the
  same mistake on a docs file an hour later
- The leak scan's two false positives were both instructive. `HX-Request`
  is documented by the templates themselves; `TariffError` was *invented*
  by the generator from the one-hierarchy rule and the package name, which
  is why the specification chose it too — a piece of evidence for what the
  benchmark is about to measure, arriving before any trial

## 2026-09-13 — The benchmark's scorer, judge and report, and what their controls found

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The efficacy benchmark can now score, judge and aggregate the trials the
  harness runs. `score.py` takes a frozen trial to a JSON score, `probes.py`
  holds the structural and web-quality probes that must run inside the
  trial's interpreter, `judge.py` builds a blind bundle and runs the judge
  through `codex exec` with the rubric as a JSON Schema, and `report.py`
  computes the paired contrasts, BCa intervals and verdict vector (#1723)
- The harness runs its authentication preflight before the first trial.
  The guard existed for exactly that and was called only by the arm B
  generator
- Decided with the owner: run the baseline now, before v3.0 moves any
  template, and run one trial attended before the other seventeen

**Pull requests merged:** 1 — #1723.

**Issues closed:** none. #1184 stays open because no trial has run, and
carries a progress comment naming the next step.

**Issues filed:** none.

**ADRs:** none owed. Benchmark tooling is not observable by a consuming
project.

**Gaps flagged:** four battery command lines were written without running
their tools, and the two new self tests are not in CI.

**Lessons:**
- The scorer's self-test passed on its first stage and proved almost
  nothing: against an empty tree every probe returned on its guard clause.
  Planting a real module in an environment with no tools found three probes
  scoring a clean zero for a tree nothing scanned, because an empty stdout
  parsed as JSON is an empty finding list. Reverting the fix turned exactly
  those three red, which is what made the stage a control
- A leak scan built over the masker's own file filter shares its blind spot
  exactly. Both skipped unrecognised suffixes, so a marker in a `.rst` file
  survived and the scan called the bundle blind. The scan has to be broader
  than the thing it checks
- A blinding marker has to be implausible as an identifier. `candidate` was
  on the list; masking it would have rewritten real code in whichever arm
  used the word, so blinding would have changed what was judged
- The project's own comment-layout rule caught a comment block in the new
  judge with code directly above it. Conformance, not smoke, reads that

## 2026-09-13 — Five benchmark gaps, filed and closed before the first trial

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- Prepared this machine for the first attended trial: a Temurin 21 Java
  runtime on the user `PATH` for the HTML validator, Playwright's Chromium
  confirmed, the scorer and report self tests and a harness dry run green
- Set the per-trial budget at $100, read against the CLI's own cost figure,
  which prices `claude-sonnet-5` at $5 and $25 per million tokens. The
  reference implementation's build, on a stronger model, came to about $13
  in 26 minutes at that rate by its transcript's token counts
- A trial inherits the machine, not the launching session. Started from
  this shell, a trial would have joined the session, taken its effort, held
  two service tokens and run `python` from this repository's `.venv` (#1725)
- A trial the usage limit ends is voided, kept under `void/`, never scored
  and re-run in its place; a stopped run resumes `--from` a trial; the run
  record is rewritten after every trial (#1726)
- Arm B's generation record is committed beside its file, where the report
  reads it (#1729)
- `judge.py --record-holdout` turns the owner's filled sheet into the scores
  file the report reads (#1728)
- `--task change` runs and scores the design's change task on a copy of
  each build trial, with churn measured against a committed start and a
  relative non-inferiority margin in the report (#1727)
- The benchmark README names what a run needs outside Python (#1735)

**Pull requests merged:** 6 — #1730, #1731, #1732, #1733, #1734, #1735.

**Issues closed:** #1725, #1726, #1727, #1728, #1729. #1184 stays open
because no trial has run.

**Issues filed:** #1725, #1726, #1727, #1728, #1729.

**ADRs:** none owed. Benchmark tooling is not observable by a consuming
project.

**Gaps flagged:**
- `C:\efficacy\dry` still holds a copy of the credentials file. Deleting it
  was denied here, so it is the owner's to remove
- The report still lacks the 10 % relative margin section 1.2 declares for
  static-analysis counts. Not filed
- A trial agent that installs packages outside a virtual environment could
  leave them for later trials. Unverified and not filed
- `CLAUDE.md` §6.2 scopes the conformance run to template prose, but
  conformance failed one of this session's PRs on files under `tests/`
- The stale remote branch `feat/quality-variadic-contract-test` remains

**Lessons:**
- A control does not have to mutate the tree. Swapping a function in the
  imported module for its previous version made each self test fail exactly
  the checks it owned, with nothing to stash or restore
- A stand-in `claude` on `PATH` drove the blocked, re-run and resume paths
  end to end without a model call. It also caught what the self tests could
  not: a refactor had left one line in the shared trial runner naming a
  variable that no longer existed there
- The budget ending was classified from a real one, not from a string in
  the binary: a run capped at $0.001 ended with status 1 and subtype
  `error_max_budget_usd` after spending $0.22, because the cap is checked
  between turns
- `cmd.exe` expands a `%NAME%` pair in an argument passed through a `.CMD`
  shim, while a lone `%` survives. Prompts now travel on stdin
- Change scoring first extracted into `scoring/`, where the judge collects
  every tree as a build trial. Reading that directory's other consumer
  before committing is what caught it
- "Byte for byte" was true of the working copy, not of the commit: Git
  normalised the record's line endings, and the PR had to be corrected

## 2026-09-14 — The first two trials, a shakedown that found three defects

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- Ran build trials A1 (control) and B1 (candidate) in
  `C:\efficacy\run-v290`, attended. Both completed: A1 cost $10.09 in 20.5
  minutes, B1 $11.36 in 21.2 minutes. Measured around B1, one build trial
  takes about 8 % of the 5-hour usage window and 1 % of the weekly limit
- Isolated a trial from what it could still reach (#1737). Git's stored
  credential helper let a trial's environment list the private hidden
  suite; A1 left a server listening on port 5551 and fourteen entries in the
  machine's temporary directory; arm B's context file names this repository
  in its footer. A trial's Git now runs with every helper cleared, each
  trial has its own temporary directory, named entries it leaves in the
  shared one are gathered, leftover processes are stopped, and each
  transcript is scanned for this repository and the hidden suite. The owner
  decided the shell keeps its network, since every trial installs packages
- The spec put the application factory "in the package". Both trials
  defined it in `tariff.web`, the suite reads `tariff.create_app`, and 147 of
  377 checks errored in both. Section 6 now names `tariff.create_app`
  (#1739)
- Scoring installed A1's package into B1: the frozen tool lock carried A1's
  own `tariff @ file:` line, so B1's coverage, import graph, API surface and
  web probes measured A1's code without an error. The lock is filtered, the
  package source is checked after the battery installs, and the complexipy,
  interrogate and coverage readings are corrected (#1741). A re-score in
  `C:\efficacy\rescore-1741` measured each trial's own package
- A1 and B1 are a shakedown. The protocol and the spec moved after them, so
  the rerun starts from A1 in a fresh root
- The previous entry's unverified leak did not occur: both trials built in
  their own `.venv`, and the system Python's Flask and pytest predate them

**Pull requests merged:** 3 — #1738, #1740, #1742.

**Issues closed:** #1737, #1739, #1741. #1184 stays open because no counted
trial has run.

**Issues filed:** #1737, #1739, #1741.

**ADRs:** none owed. The benchmark's harness, scorer and spec are not
observable by a consuming project.

**Gaps flagged:**
- The report still lacks the 10 % relative margin section 1.2 declares for
  static-analysis counts per KLOC. Not filed
- Copies of the credentials file remain under `C:\efficacy\dry\home` and
  `C:\efficacy\run-v290\home`, the owner's to delete

**Lessons:**
- The near-equal suite scores, 59.1 % and 60.2 %, were the tell. The same
  147 errors in both came from one sentence of the spec, which the suite and
  the reference implementation had read the same way
- A missing metric is loud and a metric measured on the wrong code is
  silent. B1's coverage collection error was the only visible sign that its
  environment held A1's package; its graph and surface looked plausible
- Git Bash maps `/tmp` to the machine's temporary directory whatever `TEMP`
  says. A control with `TEMP` pointed elsewhere showed it before the
  isolation was built on the assumption
- Every new check was run against a copy of its module with the rule
  broken, and a stand-in CLI drove a whole trial through the harness to
  prove the temporary directory and the cleared helper reached the agent
- The usage percentages come from the account's usage endpoint, so a
  trial's share of the quota no longer rests on a screenshot. Its reset time
  jitters across the minute, and a comparison by minute read every window
  as reset

## 2026-09-15 — The wrap-up's two open gaps, closed after it

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The report gives every static-analysis count a per-KLOC row beside its
  absolute count, and each row carries the 10 % relative margin section
  1.2 declares. Before, only lint findings had a per-KLOC row and no static
  count had a margin, so none could be claimed preserved (#1744)
- Deleted the copies of the credentials file under `C:\efficacy\dry\home`
  and `C:\efficacy\run-v290\home`. The harness copies the file into every
  run's home by design, so each run leaves one to delete
- Both were open in the previous entry, which stays as written

**Pull requests merged:** 1 — #1745.

**Issues closed:** #1744. #1184 stays open because no counted trial has
run.

**Issues filed:** #1744.

**ADRs:** none owed. The report applies a threshold the design already
fixes.

**Gaps flagged:**
- Section 1.1's escalation to K = 5 is computed nowhere. It is owed where a
  primary dimension's interval contains zero while its observed effect
  exceeds the practical threshold in section 1.2, and no file in
  `tests/efficacy` records those thresholds or states whether it is owed.
  Not filed

**Lessons:**
- A broken copy that makes a self test raise, rather than fail one check,
  still stops the run. The control has to count the exception as detection,
  or it reports a failed control for a guard that held
- The new rows were checked end to end on the re-scored trials, where each
  rendered with a value. Their contrasts stay "not computed" until an arm
  has two trials

## 2026-09-15 — The escalation to K = 5, computed before a trial reads it

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The report computes section 1.1's one escalation to K = 5: owed where a
  primary dimension's interval contains zero while its mean paired
  difference exceeds 0.5 points. At K = 3 it names the rows that owe it; at
  K = 5 it judges the first three blocks alone and prints both verdict
  vectors side by side (#1747)
- The harness refuses `--k` above 5, and the report refuses a run past it
- Section 1.1 records the two readings the design left open, settled by the
  owner before the first counted trial: any of the three contrasts triggers
  the escalation, and the effect counts by its size in either direction
- The owner set this week for benchmark testing, before v3.0 starts

**Pull requests merged:** 1 — #1748.

**Issues closed:** #1747. #1184 stays open because no counted trial has
run.

**Issues filed:** #1747.

**ADRs:** none owed. The escalation was pre-registered in the design, and
the two readings settle the benchmark's method, not the composition model.

**Gaps flagged:**
- The remote branch `feat/quality-variadic-contract-test` of merged #1683
  is still on origin. Flagged again, not deleted
- The previous entry's open gap is closed by #1747; that entry stays as
  written

**Lessons:**
- A pre-registered rule can still leave its readings open. "A primary
  dimension's interval" named neither the contrast nor the direction, and a
  reading taken only in the favourable direction would have leaned the
  stopping rule toward "better". Settle such a reading before the first
  counted trial, not when a result forces the question
- Each new guard was mutated before it was trusted. Removing the `--k` cap
  failed one harness check of 58; reading the rule in one direction failed
  exactly the planted opposite-direction case, one report check of 27

## 2026-09-16 — Four defects between a trial and its score

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- A1 and B1 re-ran in a fresh root, `C:\efficacy\run-2026-09-15`, under the
  settled protocol. Both completed: A1 $10.03 in 20.0 minutes, B1 $14.28 in
  22.9 minutes, neither reaching past its own workspace
- The HTML validity probe read html5validator's report as a list, where it
  prints one object carrying a `messages` list, and scoring crashed on the
  first trial with pages to read. It reads the object now, and sets aside
  the errors on HTMX's `hx-*` attributes, which `SPEC.md` requires of every
  arm and the HTML standard does not carry (#1750)
- Re-scoring a root that had been scored before failed on Git's read-only
  pack files. The scorer's three removals use `remove_tree` (#1752)
- The tool lock was a freeze of the first scored trial's own environment, so
  it carried A1's Flask and Flask-WTF and installed them into B1 ahead of
  its battery and web probes. It is resolved in an environment holding only
  the tools (#1754)
- Scoring and judging wrote inside the run root, where the next trial's
  workspace is created: the hidden suite's clone with its reference
  implementation, every trial's extracted code, the scores. They write to
  `<root>-scoring`, and the transcript scan flags the scoring area, the run
  root and any entry of it other than the trial's own workspace and
  temporary directory (#1756)
- In the private suite, the `db_path` fixture unlinked a database file an
  open connection still held, which on Windows errors every check in a
  module that builds the application; its cleanup ignores that now. Its
  mutation control baselined on the change-task modules, which the
  build-only reference cannot pass, and refused before testing a mutation;
  it baselines on the build modules
- The merged remote branch `feat/quality-variadic-contract-test`, flagged in
  the two previous entries, is deleted

**Pull requests merged:** 4 — #1751, #1753, #1755, #1757.

**Issues closed:** #1750, #1752, #1754, #1756. #1184 stays open because no
counted trial has run.

**Issues filed:** #1750, #1752, #1754, #1756, #1758.

**ADRs:** none owed. The scorer, the run's layout and the private suite are
not observable by a consuming project.

**Gaps flagged:**
- #1758, filed and not fixed: the browser binary for the Playwright the lock
  resolves is absent, so the suite skips its browser flows; a skipped check
  leaves the pass rate's denominator; and a metric nested under another does
  not flag when it is missing. A1 read 0.992 with the browser present and
  0.9973 without it
- A1's and B1's current scores stand only until #1758 is fixed, since they
  were taken under exactly those conditions

**Lessons:**
- Two runs of one scorer over one trial gave different scores, and the
  higher one had run fewer checks. A pass rate taken over graded checks
  alone pays a trial for a check that would not start
- A rough scan of A1's transcript matched 78 of its 90 tool calls, because a
  trial names its own workspace by absolute path in nearly every one. What
  the rule turns on is the exclusion, not the match
- A same-length edit restored within one second leaves a stale `.pyc`. The
  second control read the first's bytecode, and so did the rerun that was
  meant to show the tree clean; every control after that ran under a fresh
  `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`

## 2026-09-16 — Nine build trials, every check run

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- A check nobody ran no longer raises a trial's score. Scoring installs the
  browser for the Playwright the lock resolves, before the grader and again
  after the battery, and refuses the trial where it cannot. A skipped check
  is recorded beside the pass rate and flags the trial, and the flag list
  reaches a metric nested under another (#1758)
- Re-scored with the browser present, A1 read 0.992 with nothing skipped,
  against 0.9973 when five browser checks had been skipped
- The remaining seven build trials ran in one batch from C1. All completed
  and none was blocked, at $89.32 in total and $8.75 to $16.72 each. All nine
  trials of K = 3 are scored, with nothing skipped
- Hidden suite by arm: control .992, .984, .987; candidate .584, .989, .984;
  reference .997, .984, .992. The candidate's .584 is B1 alone: B2 and B3
  keep Flask in the core dependencies and boot
- mypy errors by arm: control 211, 381, 103; candidate 30, 146, 195;
  reference 0 in all three
- C3's transcript named the run root's shared `tmp/`, the first hit under
  the wider scan. It wrote a smoke script there, ran it and deleted it, and
  named nothing of another trial

**Pull requests merged:** 1 — #1760.

**Issues closed:** #1758. #1184 stays open: the build trials are scored, but
none has been judged and no change task has run.

**Issues filed:** none.

**ADRs:** none owed. How the scorer treats a skipped check is not observable
by a consuming project.

**Gaps flagged:**
- The nine build trials are unjudged, so the design's primary dimensions,
  and any verdict, are not computed yet. Judging spends the owner's Codex
  quota
- The nine change tasks have not run
- Arm B's context file told B1 to make its web dependencies optional, which
  `SPEC.md` section 10 rejects. One trial of three followed it. The report is
  where that finding belongs, not a template ticket filed before it

**Lessons:**
- One trial per arm would have read B1's packaging loss as the arm's pattern.
  B2 and B3 did not repeat it, which is what K = 3 is for
- A scan hit is a question to read, not a verdict. Three calls read in
  order told C3's use of the shared temp directory apart from a reach for
  another trial's work, where no rule written in advance would have

## 2026-09-17 — Round 1 reported, with no human step left in it

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The judge's bundles carried scoring's caches, whose absolute paths named
  the trial. They are left out, and a bundle whose bytes or paths name its
  trial is refused (#1762)
- The judge launches through its resolved path with the prompt on stdin, and
  refuses a CLI that reports no version (#1764)
- All nine build trials were judged by `gpt-6-astra` at effort `high`. Every
  quoted evidence line was found in its tree
- Round 1 was read for security with seven checks declared after the results.
  The report prints them without verdicts (#1766)
- All nine change tasks completed. The first batch stopped mid-freeze on C2
  when the disk filled. C2 was voided and re-ran in a second batch
- The change-task acceptance pass rate is withdrawn for suite revision
  `48f47851ed43`. Its modules build the new behaviours through names the
  change prompt never gave, and every trial failed all 22 threshold checks on
  construction (#1772)
- The human holdout is removed on the owner's decision, so no step waits on a
  person. The judge is checked only by its evidence lines (#1774)
- The reach scan reads only transcripts written since a trial started, and a
  sentence ending on the trial's own path no longer counts as a reach (#1771)
- The report lists a voided trial that no run record names (#1777), and
  wraps its prose to the declared Markdown width (#1779)
- `docs/audits/2026-09-17-efficacy.md` is round 1's report. Design and
  maintainability score 3 in every arm. Readability is A 3, B 3.33, C 4.
  Hidden suite A .988, B .852, C .991
- Change-task lines changed: A 446, B 667, C 511. B − A and B − C read worse

**Pull requests merged:** 8 — #1763, #1765, #1769, #1773, #1775, #1776, #1778
and #1780.

**Issues closed:** #1762, #1764, #1766, #1771, #1772, #1774, #1777 and #1779. The
spike #1184 stays open: round 1 is reported, and the epic #1767 and round 2 are
not started.

**Issues filed:** #1762, #1764, #1766, #1767, #1768, #1770, #1771, #1772, #1774, #1777
and #1779.

**ADRs:** none owed. The benchmark's tooling and protocol are not observable
by a consuming project.

**Gaps flagged:**
- Round 1 has no change-task acceptance measure. Round 2's change prompt
  must name the API its acceptance modules drive, tracked on #1767
- The primary dimensions rest on the model judge, checked only by its
  evidence lines
- #1768 and #1770 stay open at P3

**Lessons:**
- Nine trials failing the same 22 checks with the same message described
  the grader, not the arms. A uniform result is read against the grader
  before it is read as a finding
- A run killed mid-trial writes no record of that trial. A report that
  derives losses from records alone then states that nothing was lost
- A voided attempt and its re-run share one transcript folder, because the
  CLI keys the folder by working directory

## 2026-09-17 — Round 1's summary, from a verdict list to a score

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The report opens with a generated summary. The first form listed every
  metric read better or worse per contrast (#1782). The owner read it as a
  table, so the second form stated the findings in sentences (#1784)
- The owner then asked for something simpler. The summary is one table: per
  contrast a score from 1 to 10, the metrics won and the metrics failed. The
  score is 1 + 9 × wins ÷ (wins + fails), each metric counting once (#1786)
- The score replaces design §1.2's "no single headline number". It was
  declared after round 1's results, so §6 records it as a digest that
  decides nothing
- Round 1 scores 4.8 for the templates against no context file, 8.2 for the
  hand-written file against none, and 3.0 for the templates against the
  hand-written file
- Round 1's result is recorded on the spike, with its caveats

**Pull requests merged:** 3 — #1783, #1785 and #1787.

**Issues closed:** #1782, #1784 and #1786. The spike #1184 stays open: its
checklist asks for two stacks and a recommendation, and round 1 covers one
stack.

**Issues filed:** #1782, #1784 and #1786.

**ADRs:** none owed. The report's summary is not observable by a consuming
project.

**Gaps flagged:**
- The score weights every metric equally, so turns and cost count as much as
  design. That weighting was chosen after the results were seen
- The epic #1767's rubric item named the holdout sheet, which no longer
  exists. The reference is removed
- The P3 bugs #1768 and #1770 stay open

**Lessons:**
- A summary built to avoid a headline number read to the owner as a table.
  The reader asked for the headline, so the design now states what the
  number is allowed to decide
- Every summary form was generated from the verdicts, so each change was a
  regeneration and never a hand edit to the committed report

## 2026-09-17 — Round 1's summary, from a score to a finding in words

**Tool:** Claude Code (Fable 5.1 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The report opens with an executive summary generated from the verdicts.
  The first form answered each contrast's question in one word and named
  the metric groups won, lost and split (#1789). The owner wanted it read
  as a conclusion, in table form: one column per context file against no
  file, headed by the file's line count, with whether it improves the code,
  the primary dimensions that moved, hidden tests passed, size, cost and a
  one-phrase reading, and a line reading the columns together (#1791)
- The score table's Wins and Fails cells are counts; the vector names the
  metrics. A moved dimension prints its change alone, `readability +1`
  (#1793)
- One line per file says why it scored so. The first form repeated the rows
  as counts (#1796); the owner asked for the qualitative reading, so each
  sentence now stands on a record or verdict below with the numbers left in
  the table: a clean install that could not boot, structure built beyond
  the task, what the judge read, wins only a tool counts, patterns missed
  (#1798)
- Round 1 reads: the 406-line generated file, No — one run declared its
  dependencies so a clean install could not boot, it built more than the
  task asked for, and the judge saw none of it as better; the 39-line
  hand-written file, Yes. Together: length is not quality
- Design §6 records the table, the answer and reading rules, and the
  owner's reading against Anthropic's context-engineering guidance
- The owner asked whether arm B's file is the hybrid model pyomb runs. It
  is inline: the brief chose no model, and the harness copies only
  `SPEC.md` and `CLAUDE.md` into the workspace, so a hybrid file's
  referenced templates would not exist for the agent. Round 1 says nothing
  about the hybrid model
- Round 2 is planned as epic #1795: file length and context model, arms
  named by word — `none` (re-run), `full` (reuse), `short` (≤40 generated),
  `hybrid` (submodule vendored), `hand` (reuse) — trials `<arm>-<block>`,
  contrasts short − none, hybrid − none, short − hand, hybrid − full, about
  $90. #1767's specification extension is re-sequenced to round 3

**Pull requests merged:** 5 — #1790, #1792, #1794, #1797 and #1799.

**Issues closed:** #1789, #1791, #1793, #1796 and #1798.

**Issues filed:** #1789, #1791, #1793, #1795, #1796 and #1798.

**ADRs:** none owed. The report's opening and the arm names are the
repository's own tooling.

**Gaps flagged:**
- The judge is blind to the arm by construction and by record (`CLAUDE.md`
  removed, markers masked, zero leaks in nine bundles), but not to the
  code's own style: a templated docstring or error hierarchy stays
  recognisable. Design §5 names it
- The P3 bugs #1768 and #1770 stay open

**Lessons:**
- Every form of the opening was generated from the verdicts, so a reader's
  request for a conclusion in words became a set of sentences each
  conditioned on a verdict, never a hand edit to the committed report
- Round 1 compared a long generated file with a short hand-written one, so
  it cannot separate generated from long. The next round holds length fixed

## 2026-09-18 — Round 2 run and reported: length held fixed, the hybrid model added

**Tool:** Claude Code (Fable 5.1 1M, then Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- Epic #1795 ran end to end in one session, one pull request per task. The
  arms are words and a trial is `<arm>-<block>`: `none`, `full`, `short`,
  `hybrid`, `hand`. Round 1's letters are read as their words wherever a
  record, tarball, score, judging or voided directory names a trial, so
  round 1's root and scoring area were never rewritten on disk (#1801)
- Design §12 pre-registers the round before any trial: the five arms, the
  40-line and 88-character budget for `short` and the generator's refusal
  over either, the hybrid arm's vendored templates and what the reach and
  leak scans make of them, the four contrasts, the reading rule for
  short − hand, which contrasts cross rounds, and that the change task is
  not run this round (#1803)
- `generate_arm_b.py` became `generate_arm.py --arm`: per-arm output
  directory and record, an output-model clause in the instruction, and the
  budget refusal. Arm `short` is 40 lines, widest 75, one call of 85
  seconds; arm `hybrid` is 418 lines and refers to the vendored chain in
  forty places, one call of 228 seconds. Both leak scans clean on each
  (#1805, #1807)
- The hybrid arm's workspace carries this repository's `templates/` at
  `v2.90.0` under `docs/solid-ai-templates/`, where a submodule would put
  it, kept out of the index through `.git/info/exclude` so it counts in no
  size or scope metric. For that arm the repository is reached only under
  its owner's name, which every clone names and no path into the copy does;
  the judge strips the copy with the context file (#1807)
- `reuse.py` brings an earlier round's trials into a run root with their
  scores, judgings, security readings, transcripts and tool lock, under the
  arms' words. The scorer, judge and security reader skip a trial whose
  result is already there, each with a flag to do it anyway; the judge
  numbers new blind labels past every one the area holds, and the scorer
  refuses a root whose scores were graded at another suite revision (#1809)
- The report declares every contrast, round 1's three and round 2's four,
  and prints only those whose arms the run holds. The finding table takes
  one column per file arm, and a line under it names the arms reused from
  an earlier round and the contrasts pairing them with this round's trials
  (#1811)
- The owner read the report and found the Summary redundant beside the
  finding table. Both digested the verdict vector; the score now lives in
  one line under the table, for the contrasts between two files that the
  table has no column for, with the caveats line after it (#1820). The two
  inline columns name their model: "Templates' inline file" and "Templates'
  short inline file" (#1822)

**The result (`docs/audits/2026-09-18-efficacy.md`):** against no context
file the 406-line inline file reads Worse and the 40-line one reads Worse,
both on readability at −0.7; the hybrid and the hand-written files do not
move it. Every file arm adds files or cost. short − hand reads worse on
readability, which §12 fixed in advance as the content being the defect
rather than the length. hybrid − full scores 7.4 with no primary dimension
separating them. Round 2's bare arm scored readability 4 on all three
trials where round 1's scored 3, so hand − none, which read better in round
1, reads "did not move" here: the cross-round day confound §12 names.

**Two harness defects, each found by a trial it cost:**
- The scratch home held a credential copy taken at launch. A parallel
  session on this machine rotated the account's tokens, and the copy read
  as revoked: the 19:02 launch refused before any trial, and the relaunch's
  `none-1` died eighteen minutes and 56 turns in. The home now holds a hard
  link to the live file, re-made before every trial and every probe (#1813)
- `none-3` committed its work and printed its result at 26 minutes, and the
  run sat on it for six hours. A shell the agent left running held the
  CLI's pipes; on Windows the CLI runs behind a `.CMD` shim, so the
  two-hour timeout killed `cmd.exe` and left `claude.exe` an orphan holding
  them for good. The runner now reads the output as it comes, ends the
  whole tree two minutes after the result line or at the timeout, keeps
  what was printed, and records how the CLI ended (#1815)

**Pull requests merged:** 12 — #1802, #1804, #1806, #1808, #1810, #1812,
#1814, #1816, #1818, #1819, #1821 and #1822.

**Issues closed:** #1795 and its seven tasks #1801, #1803, #1805, #1807,
#1809, #1811 and #1820, plus the three defects #1813, #1815 and #1817.

**Issues filed:** #1801, #1803, #1805, #1807, #1809, #1811, #1813, #1815,
#1817 and #1820.

**ADRs:** none owed. Every change was the benchmark's own tooling, its two
generated arm files, or the design's own pre-registration; none moved the
composition model.

**Gaps flagged:**
- Round 3 (#1767) planned to run on round 2's winning arm against `none`,
  and no file arm won. Its task list also still names arms B and C, from
  before the word arms. The choice is the owner's
- The P3 bugs #1768 and #1770 stay open. #1768 is why the judge's
  usage-limit failures read as "wrote no final message"
- Live e2e did not run; this session cut no release
- The run roots hold 3.6 GB under `C:\efficacy`

**Lessons:**
- A credential copied into an isolated home is a snapshot of something
  another client can rotate. The link is what keeps a long run's
  authentication live, and the fix is cheap only before the run, not after
  a trial has died eighteen minutes in
- A timeout that kills the process it launched is not a timeout on the
  process doing the work, wherever a shim sits between. The harness had
  proved this once already for launching the CLI, and paid for it again on
  ending one
- Two of the round's three interruptions were the harness's own, and both
  looked like the provider cutting the run. The record said otherwise each
  time: a 401 at the minute the real credential file was rewritten, and a
  result printed six hours before the harness noticed

## 2026-09-19 — The rubric put under a control, anchored, and read by a second judge

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- Round 2's primaries turned out to carry two constants. `design` and
  `maintainability` returned 3 on all 24 judgings of rounds 1 and 2, `dip` 5
  and `ocp` 2. The prompt anchored no point on its scale — "1 is poor and 5
  is excellent" — and asked for `design` as SOLID "taken together" (#1825)
- A control settled which: a trial's tree, a damaged copy and an improved
  copy, all passing the same 47 tests, judged side by side. Unanchored,
  `design` and `maintainability` fell a point on damage and never rose, and
  on the improved tree the judge quoted `class Rule(ABC):` as its evidence
  for a 3. Six judgings of one byte-identical bundle returned readability 4,
  4, 4, 3, 4, 4 — the one primary that had moved in either round was the
  unstable one (#1825)
- Round 2's lead verdict, the templates' inline file **Worse**, was the
  control arm moving: `full`'s judgings were round 1's records, reused, and
  `none` was re-run a point higher. The same contrast read +0.333 inside
  round 1. A contrast pairing arms judged in different rounds now keeps its
  mean and interval and carries no verdict; `full` and `hand` read not
  measured, and the correction is posted on #1184 (#1826)
- The control became a fixture under `tests/efficacy/control/`: the base as
  an archive pinned by sha256, every mutation an exact-text swap that refuses
  when its target is absent, each mutated entity read back off every tree,
  and `--self-test` in CI. It is an archive because the repository's comment
  check read the committed application as its own source (#1827)
- The three primaries are anchored — 1, 3 and 5 described in the domain's
  terms — and each trial is judged three times and meaned. `--repeat` tops a
  trial up rather than adding to it, so a run cut short resumes by being
  started again. Section 12 pre-registers both before round 3 (#1827)
- Six control trees under the anchored rubric: `design` 2, 3, 4 on damage,
  base and improvement; `readability` 1 on the tree that inlines and
  abbreviates the algorithm; `maintainability` 4 only on the tree where no
  layer names a discount kind. Each row needed a tree built to move it (#1827)
- `judge.py --cli claude` reads the control through a second judge. Opus 5
  agrees with gpt-6-astra on every direction and differs on threshold: it
  credits the improvement one tree earlier (#1827)

**Pull requests merged:** #1828, #1829, #1830. #1831 is open and green.

**Issues closed:** #1825, #1826.

**Issues filed:** #1825, #1826, #1827, #1832.

**ADRs:** none owed. Everything changed is the benchmark's own tooling; the
method changes are pre-registered in the design's section 12.

**Gaps flagged:**
- #1831 awaits merge, and #1827 closes with it
- The gpt-6-astra control readings are one judging per tree, and single
  judgings flip between runs. The top-up to three stopped on the judge
  plan's usage limit with eleven owed; the same command resumes it
- Fable was not run: the installed Claude Code, 2.1.153, does not support
  it, so the second judge's readings are Opus 5
- #1832, a lock against two judge runs on one root, is open; `score.py`,
  `security.py` and `harness.py` are not yet checked for the same shape
- Round 3 (#1767) waits on the arm choice. The anchored prompt makes its
  primaries incomparable to rounds 1 and 2 unless their trees are re-judged
- Disposable control roots sit under `C:\efficacy`; `control-six` and
  `control-fable` hold the readings the control README cites

**Lessons:**
- A score that never varies is the first thing to validate, not the last.
  Twenty-four identical readings looked like a finding about the arms and
  were a property of the prompt
- A control that can only show damage validates half an instrument: an arm
  can never win on a row that only falls. Each row has to fall on the tree
  built to damage it and rise on the tree built to improve it — the first
  degradation changed no function body, so a flat `readability` there said
  nothing, and the first `maintainability` anchor described an axis that
  degradation never touched
- A verdict across two rounds reads the day as well as the arm, and stating
  the confound beside the verdict does not stop the verdict being read
- A background job outlives the session that started it. Resuming work that
  looked interrupted, without checking for a live process, put a second run
  on the same root; its cleanup emptied the first run's bundle mid-judging.
  The evidence share caught it, and the outcome field still said `judged`

## 2026-09-19 — Three harness bugs fixed, and the rubric issue closed

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- #1831's body read "Part of #1827", so its merge left #1827 open. The item
  still open on it, `ocp` and `dip` sitting at their extremes, was answered
  from the control's judgings: `ocp` rises from 2 to 3 on every improved tree
  under both judges, and `dip` falls from 5 to 1 on the degraded tree. Their
  extremes in rounds 1 and 2 describe the code, so neither row is anchored or
  withdrawn. Posted on #1827, which closes
- A live run of `judge.py`, `score.py` or `security.py` refuses a second run
  of the same tool against its scoring area. A run claims the area with
  `<tool>.running`, naming its pid. A marker whose process still runs that
  tool refuses, and one whose process ended or whose pid was reused is taken
  over. `score.py` re-clones the hidden suite at every start, so two scoring
  runs collided even on different trials; `harness.py` already refuses a
  reused workspace (#1832)
- A judge CLI refused by the model leaves its final-message file empty. The
  failure now carries the tail of what the CLI printed, where the cause is
  (#1768)
- A dry run prepares its workspaces, home and record in `<root>-dry-run` and
  leaves the root as it found it, so the run that follows uses the same
  root. The build task had the same defect as the change task the issue
  named (#1770)
- Cleanup: 2,457 test reports removed, and the shakedown roots `run-v290`
  and `rescore-1741` deleted, 1.4 GB. No run home under `C:\efficacy` holds
  a credentials file

**Pull requests merged:** #1831, #1833, #1834, #1835, #1836.

**Issues closed:** #1768, #1770, #1827, #1832.

**Issues filed:** none.

**ADRs:** none owed. Everything changed is the benchmark's own tooling.

**Gaps flagged:**
- The eleven gpt-6-astra control judgings are still owed; the judge plan's
  limit resets on 2026-09-25 at 09:52
- Fable needs `claude update`; round 3 (#1767) waits on the arm choice
- #1707, the one open bug in the milestone, needs a paid canary run
- The claim is per tool: `score.py --rescore` can still clear a tree a live
  judge run is reading. Not filed

**Lessons:**
- "Closes with" is a claim about a pull request's body. The previous
  entry's gap said #1827 closes with #1831; the body said "Part of", and
  only reading it showed the issue would stay open
- A control reproduces the behaviour the fix replaced, and no more. The
  first control for #1770 pointed the dry run at the root but kept the
  fix's clearing step, so it deleted the root. Every check then failed for a
  reason none of them names, which still looks like a working control
- A check that drives `main` past a guard has to make what follows the
  guard harmless. With the claim removed, the judge's refusal check ran on
  into the real CLI. It now runs dry, so a regression spends nothing

## 2026-09-24 — The efficacy design read by its owner, and round 3's grader built

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5.5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The v3.0 groom's upstream actions were applied to the milestone:
  - #330 closed as won't do and #562 closed as decided
  - #717, #1050 and #1006 moved to the backlog
  - #1504 raised to P1, #1292 retitled as the migration guide
  - the milestone's description set to the fork model

  Recreating the fork-homed issues waits on where the fork lives.
- The owner read the efficacy design section by section. The review
  produced 20 fixes, shipped as four PRs:
  - the brief and change prompt moved out of the design into files, so
    the restructure could not break the code that read them by heading
    (#1843)
  - arm directories named after their arms, and `short − full` added as
    the eighth contrast (#1844)
  - the design rewritten for its reader, with plain words, tables, bullets,
    diagrams, numbered sections, a decision log and an appendix (#1845)
  - the operator README rewritten the same way (#1846)
- Round 3 decisions, recorded on #1767:
  - start anew with all five arms, reusing no earlier trial
  - eight contrasts
  - security and data protection each read two ways, by an anchored judge
    row and a probe pass rate, all primary. The probe margins mean "no
    probe lost" (#1847)
  - the new judge rows' control base comes from one uncounted calibration
    trial
- The change prompt now names the API, form fields and rules its grader
  drives. Round 1's pass rate was withdrawn because the grader drove names
  the prompt never gave (#1848)
- The brief names customers as personal data under the GDPR. `hand`
  gains two generic lines, chosen over lines that mirror the probes (#1849)
- The private suite was extended by three agents, none of which saw the
  others' work: 534 build checks, 74 change checks, and 12 of 12
  mutations caught (`braboj/tariff-hidden-suite` 65bfb9a)
- solid-ai-dirigent got the label scheme, and #7 and #8 were filed: tests
  must fail before the feature exists, and an opt-in adversarial tester

**Pull requests merged:** #1843, #1844, #1845, #1846, #1847, #1848, #1849.

**Issues closed:** #330, #562.

**Issues filed:** solid-ai-dirigent #7 and #8.

**ADRs:** none owed. Everything changed is the benchmark's own tooling,
inputs and design document.

**Gaps flagged:**
- #1850 (design §11's measured suite count) is open, awaiting merge
- #1767 still owes:
  - the probes in scoring
  - the anchored security rows and the calibration trial
  - `PRIMARY`, `MARGINS` and `PRACTICAL`
  - regenerating `full`, `short` and `hybrid`
  - the run itself
- Where the fork lives is unanswered, which blocks recreating the
  fork-homed issues and D1
- The gpt control top-up waits on the judge plan's reset, 2026-09-25 09:52

**Lessons:**
- A first-run full pass needs a control that must fail. The new suite
  passed the new reference 534/534. The earlier reference, which has no
  sign-in, then showed 19 sign-in checks passing vacuously: a token taken
  from a page that did not exist, and "signed in" read as "`/` answered
  200"
- A gate chained with `;` lets the commit through when the gate fails. The
  change-prompt PR's first push failed CI on comment layout for exactly
  that reason. Chain gates with `&&`
- Drafting lines for a hand-written arm while knowing the probes writes the
  answer key into the arm. The owner chose generic lines instead
- An earlier finding of mine was wrong: the second judge reads only the
  control fixture, never a round. Check a claim against the component's
  own README before building on it

## 2026-09-25 — Round 3's judge rows pass the control, under a new judge

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5.5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The gpt-6-astra control top-up finished. At three judgings per tree,
  every primary falls on its damaged tree and rises on an improved one
  (#1853)
- `security` and `data_protection` joined the judge's rubric as anchored
  primaries, and a self-test check now fails when the judge and the report
  disagree on the primaries (#1854)
- The control gained a second pinned application: one uncounted
  calibration trial on the extended spec, `claude-sonnet-5`, arm `none`.
  Four trees were built from it to move the new rows. Every tree fails the
  same hidden-suite checks as its base (#1852, #1855)
- The control showed both new rows falling on damage and never rising:
  the calibration application already met their 5s. Both were re-anchored
  (#1858)
- gpt-6-astra hit its plan's weekly limit 16 judgings into the re-run.
  The owner made `claude-opus-5-5` the rounds' judge, with gpt-6-astra as
  a cross-check on a sample (#1858)
- The claude backend had recorded effort `high` and never passed it. It
  now does, and a self-test check fails without it (#1858)
- Under Opus 5.5 at `high`, design did not fall: the base and the damaged
  tree both scored 2 on the same dispatch. Design's 1 and 3 were
  rewritten, and the final control passes all five primaries (#1858)
- The 14 security and data-protection probes were built in `security.py`.
  A probe the trial keeps from running is lost, not missing, on the
  owner's decision (#1857)
- The PLAYBOOK's account of the control now describes two applications

**Pull requests merged:** #1850, #1851, #1852, #1853, #1854, #1855,
#1857, #1858.

**Pull requests closed unmerged:** #1856, replaced by #1857 because its
first commit carried a value gitleaks reads as a secret.

**Issues closed:** none.

**ADRs:** none owed. The judge, the anchors and the probe rule are the
benchmark's own; they are rows in the design's decisions table.

**Gaps flagged:**
- #1767 still owes:
  - the probes run by `score.py` and read as primaries by `report.py`,
    with their margins and thresholds
  - regenerating `full`, `short` and `hybrid` from the new brief
  - the run itself
- The gpt-6-astra cross-check waits on its plan's reset, 2026-10-02 11:34
- The calibration trial does not seed an empty database. So its
  hidden-suite comparison covers only the checks it passes, and its
  sign-in probes are lost

**Lessons:**
- A control built on a base that already meets the top anchor can show a
  fall and never a rise. Read where the base lands before trusting a row
  that only falls
- A reading's recorded setting must be the one the tool ran with: the
  effort field said `high` for every claude judging while the CLI used its
  own default
- gitleaks scans every branch's history. A test sentinel named like a
  secret cannot be fixed by a later commit, only by a fresh branch and
  deleting the old one
- A validation script's missing flag looks like a hang: the hidden suite
  ran 13 minutes without `--suite build` against 2 with it. Copy the
  caller's arguments when calling a tool by hand

## 2026-09-26 — The probes join scoring and the report, and the arms are regenerated

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5.5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- The calibration trial's missing seed was traced to its own code: it
  seeds only through `tariff seed`, while SPEC §8 says the application
  seeds an empty database. §8 now says it does so when it starts, and
  `judge.py` registers the previous spec's hash so the control's second
  application is still judged against its own (#1860, #1861)
- `score.py` files a security reading for each build trial it scores, and
  `report.py` leads with the security and data-protection probe pass rates
  as primaries: margins 2 and 10 pp, thresholds 9 and 30 pp. A run whose
  readings carry probes prints no post-hoc security section (#1862)
- `full`, `short` and `hybrid` were regenerated from the brief that names
  personal data. `short` was refused twice for width, so its instruction
  now asks the model to measure every line before answering; the third
  generation fits. Conformance's width and figure checks leave the arm
  files out, as generator output (#1863)

**Pull requests merged:** #1859, #1861, #1862, #1863.

**Issues closed:** #1860.

**ADRs:** none owed. The seed timing, the probe primaries and the width
instruction are the benchmark's own; the last is a row in the design's
decisions table.

**Gaps flagged:**
- #1767 still owes round 3 itself: 15 build and 15 change trials, about
  90 judgings, and the report
- Whether to patch `base-2.zip` to seed on start is undecided. Unpatched,
  its hidden-suite comparison covers only what it passes and its sign-in
  probes are lost
- The gpt-6-astra cross-check waits on its plan's reset, 2026-10-02 11:34

**Lessons:**
- A spec edit changes the hash a judge recognises a tree's spec by.
  Register the old hash before any tree carrying it is judged, or the
  control's trees stop resolving
- A generator refused for a bound twice in a row is a cause, not bad
  luck: nine lines over is not one sample away from passing
- Regenerated fixtures fall under every check that reads the whole tree.
  Run conformance on them before calling a regeneration done

## 2026-09-27 — Round 3 runs, and five measurement defects are fixed before its report

**Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5.5 1M)

**Key changes:**
- Round 3 ran on `4a5df4d`: 15 build and 15 change trials under
  `claude-sonnet-5`, none blocked, $36.85 for the builds, and 45 judgings
  by `claude-opus-5-5`. Its report answers Yes for the inline file
  (readability +0.7), Worse for the short and hybrid files, No for the
  hand-written one, and owes the escalation to K = 5 (#1888)
- Five defects in the ruler were found by reading the first scores and fixed
  before the report, each with a control: the judge's bundle carried a venv
  and user caches naming the trial (#1866); scoring never gave the
  application the administrator password seeding needs (#1868); the SQL
  probe counted interpolated constants (#1882); the enumeration probe read a
  fresh CSRF token in an HTMX header as a difference (#1884); the report's
  escalation command named round 1's `A4` (#1880). The closing reading now
  names the files it compares (#1886)
- `base-2.zip` stays unpatched, by the owner's decision: round 3 does not
  read it, and a patch would void the control's second-application readings
- ADR-047: files under `docs/` take kebab-case from v3.0, and the playbook
  keeps its noun (#1291). ADR-048: a lessons log replaces this journal from
  v3.0 (#1870)
- Filed for v3.0: consolidating the standard documents so README, CONTRIBUTING
  and the playbook each answer one question (#1872), and epic #1873 with six
  spikes testing where the templates help beyond a one-shot build from a
  precise spec
- The efficacy README names `--arms` for the change task, the disk a round
  needs, and that the checkout's HEAD stays put during a run (#1889)

**Pull requests merged:** #1864, #1865, #1867, #1869, #1871, #1881, #1883,
#1885, #1887, #1888, #1889.

**Issues closed:** #1291, #1866, #1868, #1880, #1882, #1884, #1886.

**ADRs:** ADR-047 and ADR-048. The probe rule is the benchmark's own and is a
row in the design's decisions table.

**Gaps flagged:**
- #1767 owes the escalation to K = 5 on the judge's security row, and the
  owner's decision on coverage for the 9 trials whose tests import
  `html5lib`
- The drive holding `C:\efficacy` has 2.2 GB free; the escalation needs
  about 10 GB
- The gpt-6-astra cross-check waits on its plan's reset, 2026-10-02 11:34

**Lessons:**
- Read the first scores for a metric that is missing on every trial before
  judging anything: a missing value shared by all arms is the ruler, not the
  arms
- A probe that fails nearly every trial and passes only the arm that
  happens to avoid one coding pattern is measuring the pattern. Read the
  flagged lines before the rate
- Two background jobs sharing a nearly full disk both die. Run a round's
  steps one after another and delete each scored environment once its
  score is written
