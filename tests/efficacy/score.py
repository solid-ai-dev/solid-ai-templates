"""Score one frozen efficacy trial with the deterministic backbone.

The design, the metric directions and the verdict rule live in
`docs/design/efficacy-benchmark.md`. This module owns the part of section 5
that needs no judgement: the clean install, the hidden acceptance suite, the
static battery, the scope count and the cost read off the trial record. The
structural design probes and the web-quality probes live in `probes.py`; the
model judge in `judge.py`; the contrasts and the report in `report.py`.

Two rules run through everything here.

A tool that errored, timed out, or scanned nothing records the metric as
missing and flags the trial. It never records zero: zero findings and
nothing scanned are the same number and opposite facts.

Source roots are discovered, never assumed. The arms choose their own
layout, and `src/` is one of the things a context file might introduce, so a
tool pointed at a hard-coded `src` reads an empty directory for a valid flat
layout and reports a clean trial.
