"""Judge one frozen efficacy trial, blind.

The design's section 5 fixes what this asks for: a 1-5 rubric with a quoted
evidence line per score, a pattern census that says what each pattern removes
or opens, and the three primary dimensions the report leads with. Section 7
fixes the controls: blind to arm, order shuffled, condition markers
stripped, model id and reasoning effort recorded, and a judge from another
vendor reading a sample as a cross-check.

Two properties make the result readable as evidence rather than as an
opinion. The rubric is a JSON Schema the CLI enforces on the final message,
so a score is machine-read by construction. And every evidence line is
checked against the bundle it was supposedly quoted from: a judge that never
opened the code can still return plausible numbers, and the share of evidence
that is actually present in the tree is what separates the two.

PROMPT = """\
You are reviewing one submission that implements the application described in
SPEC.md, which is in the directory you have been given. Read the code before
scoring it; every score must quote a line from the tree.

Score each dimension from 1 to 5, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent:

- design: SOLID overall and pattern use, taken together
- srp: one reason to change per module
- ocp: rule kinds, jurisdictions and export formats are extension points
- lsp: every rule kind honours the rule contract, every export the renderer's
- isp: the public API is no larger than the specification requires
- dip: the domain is independent of Flask, SQLite and the request cycle
- naming_and_abstraction: names carry intent at a consistent level
- error_design: one error hierarchy, refusals where the specification says
- readability: function length, nesting, names a reader can follow
- maintainability: how quickly a reader finds where a change goes
- test_quality: what the tests assert, not how many there are
- security: how sign-in, sessions, secrets and queries are defended
- data_protection: how the customers' personal data is held, logged,
  exported and erased

Five of those carry the report and are anchored, so that 3 is a described
place on the scale rather than wherever ordinary work lands. Score against
the description nearest what you read, and use 2 and 4 for the gaps between.

design
  1  the layers are not kept apart: the domain's modules are merged into
     one, or the domain imports the web framework, and adding a discount
     kind means editing the algorithm, the form and the template
  3  the domain is a set of modules of its own that imports nothing from
     the web layer, and the algorithm dispatches on concrete rule classes,
     so a new kind reopens more than one function; that dispatch alone, with
     the layers kept apart, is a 3 and not lower
  5  a discount kind is added by writing one class: the algorithm, the
     persistence mapping, the form and the template read a contract or a
     registry and name no kind of their own

readability
  1  functions run past a screen with nested conditionals, names abbreviate,
     and the algorithm has to be held in the head to be followed
  3  followable, with dense expressions or accumulators whose shape has to be
     reconstructed before the surrounding code reads
  5  each function does one thing at one level, names carry the intent, and
     no expression needs a second reading

maintainability
  1  the modules do not divide the work: one of them holds the domain and
     the layers around it together, so a reader has no boundary to start
     from and the pricing rules sit beside the web framework they import
  3  the modules divide along lines a reader can name and the domain is
     quick to find, but one discount kind's behaviour is still spread
     across the algorithm, the persistence layer and the templates
  5  each module's responsibility is evident from where it sits, the
     domain depends on nothing layered above it, and every fact about a
     discount kind sits in one place

security
  1  a secret sits in plain sight or input reaches a query or a redirect
     unchecked: the password stored or compared as typed, the secret key a
     literal in the source, SQL built from strings, `next` followed wherever
     it points
  3  the common defences are all present - a hashed password, parameterised
     queries, one sign-in guard, a CSRF token on every form, `next` checked
     for a local path - and the application stops there: the secret key
     comes from a default or a file the deployment cannot set, and the
     session cookie and the responses carry only the framework's defaults
  5  everything in 3, and the deployment is configured on purpose: the
     secret key is read from the environment, the session cookie's flags
     are set, every response carries security headers, and each check a
     reviewer audits, such as the redirect target, is one named function

data_protection
  1  personal data escapes: customer fields are written to the logs, erasure
     leaves the data behind, or an export reaches past one customer
  3  erasure and export do what the specification asks, but nothing names
     what is personal: each query, view and template lists the fields or
     checks the erased flag for itself, so the next field or page added is
     one to forget
  5  one declaration names the personal fields, and erasure, export and
     every read of a single customer go through it; an erased customer
     cannot be read by accident, and erased data does not linger in the
     database file

A submission that removes what a lower anchor describes scores above it, even
where the result is ordinary: these are descriptions of the code, not of how
impressive it is.

For each score, `evidence` must be a short verbatim line copied from a file in
the tree, and `file` the path it came from. Do not paraphrase the line.

Then census the design patterns you find. For each: where it is, what it
removes (a duplication, a conditional ladder) or opens (an extension point),
how many implementors it has, and a verdict - `warranted` when it removes or
opens something real, `over_engineered` when it has one implementor and
removes nothing, `missed` for a place where a pattern was warranted and a
conditional ladder stands instead.

Answer with JSON only, in the shape the schema requires.
