"""Aggregate scored trials into the report the design's section 6 fixes.

Per metric: the mean per arm, the three paired contrasts, a bias-corrected and
accelerated bootstrap interval over the paired differences, and the verdict
read against that metric's declared direction. Nothing here decides by eye,
and nothing here decides a direction either: both the direction and the
verdict rule were fixed before any trial ran.

Two properties of K = 3 are carried into the output rather than hidden in it.
Every interval is labelled descriptive, because no arrangement of three
paired differences reaches conventional significance. And a metric whose
bootstrap distribution is degenerate — three identical differences — reports
the fallback it used instead of an interval it cannot compute.
